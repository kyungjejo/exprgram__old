time, and I cannot imagine... ...two people more perfect for each other.<br>And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room... ...we shall proceed to the vows.<br>Monica?<br>He took off?<br>Go on.<br>Go on.<br>Chandler, for so long...<br>...I wondered if I would ever find my prince.<br>My soul mate.<br>Then three years ago, at another wedding...<br>...I turned to a friend for comfort.<br>And instead I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life.<br>And now... ...here we are... ...with our future before us.<br>And I only want to spend it with you.<br>My prince.<br>My soul mate.<br>My friend.<br>Unless you don't want to.<br>You go.<br>Chandler?<br>No, that's okay.<br>I thought this would be the most difficult thing I ever had to do.<br>But when I saw you walking down that aisle, I realized it's simple.<br>I love you.<br>Any surprises that come our way, it's okay, because I will always love you.<br>You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with.<br>You want to know if I'm sure?<br>You may now kiss the bride.<br>I guess by the powers vested in me by the state of New York... ...and the Internet guys...<br>...I now pronounce you
