Come on, you!
Crazy!
Oh, my God!
What?
Nothing.
What's wrong?
I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my mother.
The mom you met in Montauk?
She was a cat?
That makes the fact that she owns beachfront property all the more impressive.
No.
She was a human lady.
This is the spirit of my mom, Lilly.
The one that killed herself.
Have you been taking your grandmother's glaucoma medicine again?
No, Dr. Skeptismo.
I'm sure.
First of all, there's the feeling.
And for another, she went into my guitar case... ...which is lined with orange felt.
My mother's favorite fish was orange roughy.
Cats like fish.
You had me with orange felt.
Hi, Mommy!
I haven't seen this smile in 17 years.
Phoebe's mom's got a huge pair of Let it go!
She keeps trying to get away.
Just like when she was alive.
How long is your mom going to be with us?
I'm not sure.
I guess until she gets used to the fact that there's... ...a new mom.
Now she's worried that she'll be replaced.
That's not going to happen, is it?
I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the BEACH.
I just spelled the wrong word.
So am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom remind anyone else of a cat?
Ross, don't start.
You actually believe there's a woman inside that cat?
I believe it.
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.
No, you You know what?
You won't suck me into this.
Sure I will.
Because you always have to be right.
I do not always have Okay, okay.
Jurassic Park could happen.
You won't believe what I found on a telephone pole.
Look familiar?
Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name "Julio."
A little girl's looking for this cat.
Know what that means?
Yeah!
$200 reward split five ways!
Do we have to tell her?
Yes, we do.
But it's made her so happy.
Little girl misses her cat.
Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.
I have to go have dinner with my son.
Can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her?
Thank you.
I hate when Ross is right.
He is right, isn't he?
This might be one time when he's wrong.
You think?
Oh, no.
He's right.
About your mom.
How's that going?
So great.
We took a nap together today.
Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.
That's so sweet.
I'm gonna get some coffee.
What'd you say, Joe?
I'll be right there.
I just feel so... All right!
Told me he just went out with Leslie Maskin.
You don't want to see this, do you?Hell, yeah!
I am not gonna show you this.
Not the sex part.Just the stuff leading up to it.
Forget it.
We'll think of another way to put the"who came on to who" thing to rest.
Come on now, think!
It's Rachel's tape,and she can do whatever she wants.
And she wants to destroy it,so end of story.
I want to see it.What?
You don't want us to see this.
You so badly don't want us to see itthat it makes me want to see it.
Are we watching the tape or not?
It's for your sake.I don't believe you.
I think you don't want themto see you begging me.
Rachel, please?Oh, a little preview.
Fine.
I want the record to showthat I tried to take the high road.
Because in about five minutes,I'm gonna be saying..
Okay, here we go.
I'm so happy.
Thank God you're here.
Help me.Were you talking to yourself?
There I am.You're gonna get pregnant.
I screwed up so bad.
I told Monica that I'd sendthose wedding invitations weeks ago.
You didn't do it?
I put them in my desk at work,and forgot about them until today.
Sweetie, it's okay.
Everybody made itto the wedding.
I'm fine.
Kind of hurting my hand though.I know.
I can 't believe it, especially afterMonica went on and on about it.
"Here are the invitations, Rachel.Be very careful, Rachel.
Please, drinking no liquidsaround the invitations, Rachel."
Did you do it on our invitations?
Not on the ones we sent out.
So just the ones you gave back to usand we had framed?
It seems like yesterdaythey just got engaged.
I know.
Remember the night they got engaged?How you and I almost..   Oh, I remember how we almost.
You think we would'vegone through with it?
You think we would have done it?
I know I wanted to.I just wasn 't sure if you did.
Oh, I wanted to.
So we both wanted to.
Interesting.
Anyway, it probably worked outfor the best.
Yeah, sure.
In about 10 seconds, he kisses me.
In about 5 seconds, you'll see why.
Did I ever tell you about the timeI backpacked through Western Europe?
Get ready to see some begging.
Oh, you came on to Ross!What?
Now I'm so happy.
What?You used the Europe story!
That's the magic story you usewhen you want to have sex!
How do you know about that story?How do you know about that story?
My friend Irene heard itfrom some guy.
Some guy!
No, she told me thathis name was Ken Adams.
You know what?
We are interesting,funny people with good questions.
Remember that necklace I gave you last year?
Can I see it?
Why?
I just want to check something.
Okay.
Now we'll see.
Air hole!
Air hole!
Here it is.
I love it.
I wear it all the time.
The necklace I got you was gold.
This is silver.
Well, maybe... ...it changed.
Oh, my God!
You actually exchanged it.
Isn't it better to exchange it for something I enjoy... ...and can use a lot?
What did you get?
Credit.
I'll get it.
You kissed my girlfriend!
I like those sunglasses.
"Like them" like them?
Or "I'd like to get store credit" like them?
This turkey is ready.
Where can I wash up?
Let me show you.
The towels are hanging next to the sink.
And you can use the fancy soap.
Thank you.
Fancy soap?
I thought we were saving that for the pope.
See.
He's nice, right?
Do you want a relationship where you can actually say: "That's not how your dad used to do it"?
Everything looks great.
Where should I sit?
Saved you a seat.
Sick, sick, sick, sick.
I'll get it.
Got you!
That doesn't sound like thinking to me.
Sorry!
You shouldn't be talking at all.
You've got too much thinking to do to be talking and joking.
Okay, you got it!
Ross, pass me the yams?
Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
Will you stop!
What's the matter with you?
We've got company.
Nothing's the matter with me.
I'm not completely devoid of sentiment.
I have feelings.
Okay, fine.
You can't tell, but I'm breaking the tension by mooning you guys.
All right, look!
Don't say that I have no sentiment.
This is a movie stub from our first date.
This eggshell is from the first time you made me breakfast in bed.
This is from the museum, the first time we... ...were together.
Maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter.
I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry.
Though you're not supposed to take these.
It's, like, a million years old.
We actually have people looking for that.
You have very beautiful... ...eye.
My friends think this is weird.
Even the one in the box?
It's not weird, is it?
I thought it would be.
I almost canceled, but it really isn't.
I know.
Me and your dad, that's totally separate.
I totally agree.
We're two people who find each other... ...very attractive.
Right?
What?
Nothing, nothing.
No, really.
Was that not okay?
No, that was good.
That was a good kiss.
It reminded you of Don't say it!
You did some real good thinking in there.
I think there's somethingthat we really need to talk about.
I think we do.
Why don't we go inside.
Look, I know why you're here.You do?
Yeah, and to save youfrom any embarrassment..
I think maybe I should talk first.
Okay.Okay?
Ross and Rachel.
Rachel and Ross.
That's been one heck of a seesaw,hasn't it?
What?
I mean, look, that one night we hadwas fun and certainly passionate.
But don't you think it's betterif we just stay friends?
Seriously, what?
Okay.
You know what?
If you want to,we can do it one more time.
I mean, I'd be okay with that.In fact, I have some time right now..
Okay.
You know what?
Can I talk now?
Oh, sure.Okay.
I'm pregnant.
Ross?
Ross?
Okay, whenever you're ready.
And you're the father, by the way.But you got..   Can I get you some water?I'm good.
Ross, there is no pressure on you, okay?
Imean, you can be as involved as you want.
Yeah, I..
I'm just, I don't know.I don't understand..   how this happened.
We used a condom.I know.
But you know, condoms only work,like, 97 percent of the time.
What?
What?!
Well, they should put that on the box!
They do.No, they don't!
Well, they should put itin huge block letters!
Ross, let's just forget about the condoms.Well, I may as well have!
Listen, you know what?I was really freaked out too..   when I found out.Freaked..?
Hey, I'm not freaked out.
I'm indignant as a consumer!
You know what?
Let's talk later.No, I wanna talk now.
In fact, I wanna talk..   to the presidentof the condom company.
Okay, you know what?Maybe I should come back..
Okay.
Yeah, I'll press one!
I need to talk to her.Didn't you two already talk?
Do you have the Ralph Lauren file?
Oh, yeah, sure!
It's right... What's that?
It's from Ross.
It's a Love Bug.
Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend.
No, that's not what he's doing.
He's just really romantic.
Excuse me.
Are you Rachel Greene?
Yes.
One, two, three.
Congratulations on your first week At your brandnew job It won't be long Before you're the boss And you know who will be there To support you Your one and only boyfriend It's nice to have a boyfriend!
Your loyal, loving boyfriend, Ross!
I'm hurt!
I'm actually hurt... ...that you'd think I'd send you any of those things out of anything but love.
Hurt!
Hurt!
All right, Ross.
I get it.
You're hurt!
Can't a guy send a barbershop quartet... ...to his girlfriend's office anymore?
Oh, please!
Ross, it was so obvious.
It was like you were marking your territory.
You might as well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
I would never do that.
Look, I know what's going on here, okay?
Mark explained it all to me.
He said this is what you guys do.
Yeah, well, if Mark said that, then Mark's an idiot.
Mark's a genius.
Why?
How?
How is he a genius?
Don't you see what's happening here?
Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidante.
Now he's gonna be the guy she goes to, to complain about you.
What am I gonna do?
Why don't you send her a musical bug?
No, you already did that.
All right, you're gonna have to go there yourself now.
Make a few surprise visits.
I don't know, you guys.
Fine, don't do anything.
Just sit and talk to us.
Meanwhile, she is talking to him about you.
And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive.
She starts thinking, "Maybe this is the guy for me because he understands me."
And before you know it, she's with him.
And you'll be all, "Oh, man!"
And he'll be all, "Yes!"
And us, we'll be like, "Oh, dude!"
And pretty soon you'll be like: "Hi."
And, "Well, I can't go.
Rachel and Mark might be there."
And we'll be like, "Man, get over it!
It's been four years!"
He paints quite a picture, doesn't he?
Here's the Shelley Segal stuff for December.
Wait, I've got something for you.
Mark.
It's okay.
Rachel knows.
Yeah, but even so.
I can't help it.
I'm just crazy about you.
Oh, that is so sweet!
I know I'm Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough.
I mean, I see you walking around, and I want to touch you and hold you.
Come on, no one's around.
Just kiss me.
All right, that's it!
Get off of her!
What is going on?
What's going on?
I'll tell you what's going on!
Ross!
I have been down in your store for 20 minutes, trying to get a tie.
What do I have to do to get some service?
Hi, Rach.
What are you wrapping?
Look, about what happened earlier...
I completely understand.
You were stressed.
I was gonna give you a chance to apologize to me.
For what?
For letting you throw me out of your office?
You had no right coming down to my office, Ross.
You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work... ...unless maybe they were a park ranger.
Well, excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary.
Boy, what an ass am I.
But I told you I didn't have the time.
Yeah, well, you never have the time.
I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
What do you want from me?
You want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
No, but it would be nice if you'd realize that it's just a job.
Just a job?
Yes.
Do you realize this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I care about?
This is the first time I'm doing something I'm actually good at?
I mean, if you don't get that...
I get that.
I get that bigtime, and I'm happy for you.
I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine.
I don't know what to do anymore.
Well, neither do I!
Is this about Mark?
Oh, my God!
Okay, it's not.
Oh, my God!
I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross.
You're making this too hard.
I'm making this too hard?
Okay, what do you want me to do?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Look... ...maybe we should take a break.
Okay.
Okay, fine.
You're right.
Let's take a break.
Let's cool off.
Okay.
Let's get some frozen yogurt or something.
No.
A break from us.
And then we got into this big, stupid fight...
It was awful.
I told him he treats me like a park ranger, something... And then...
...I told him I wanted to take a break.
I don't want to take a break.
I'm sorry.
Egg roll?
No.
And then I called him, and he wasn't there.
Well, he's probably just out.
Well, thank you, that's very helpful.
I'm glad you came over.
Hi, it's me.
Hi.
I'm so glad you called.
Really?
I've been thinking this is crazy.
Don't you think we can work on this?
Hey, what do you wanna drink?
Who's that?
Nobody?
Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
Is that Mark?
Honey, look, he just came over...  Yeah, got it!
Hey, dinosaur guy.
Look at you, so sad.
Come dance.
That's okay.
Thanks.
You don't have to smile.
You just have to dance.
I don't feel like dancing.
I feel like having a drink, okay?
Okay.
Hey, two beers.
I like this song.
Well, you're practically dancing already.
Why don't you just do it over here?
No.
What, are you married?
Because that's okay.
Be home, be home, be home.
You're not home.
Still no smile?
This is my sister, Amy.
This is Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, and you know Mon.
Oh, my God.
You're on Days of Our Lives!
Yeah.
Wow!
They must put a lot of makeup on you.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Hey.
Hi.
So welcome.
Is this the first time you're seeing Emma?
Yeah, I think so.
It's nice to meet you, Emma.
Phoebe.
That's a funny noise.
Phoebe?
I hate it.
Hey!
I'm also a great moron.
Hey.
Where's the baby?
We just put her down for a nap.
Listen, I was just thinking.
You know what would be incredible?
If you guys died!
Thank you, Amy.
No, no, then I would get the baby.
It would be just like a movie.
At first I wouldn't know what to do with her.
And then I would rise to the occasion.
Then I'd get a makeover and get married.
That's a great movie!
Now, listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything..   because you know, you'd be dead.
But I was thinking about changing her name.
I'm just not really a big fan of Emily.
Emma.
Emma?
Ross wants you.
Phoebe!
Why does she keep making that noise?
Honey, I don't know how to tell you this..   but if something were to happen to Ross or myself..    you wouldn't get the baby.
Well, who would?
Well, we haven't officially asked them yet..   but we would want Monica and Chandler.
Who?
You're in their apartment.
I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
Oh, my God, I'm so moved.
I don't believe this.
Hold on a second.
You guys die..   and I don't get your baby?
Amy, see, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler.
We see them every day.
And truthfully, you don't seem connected to the baby.
Connected?
To what?
She's a lump.
You know, guys, I've gotta say this means so much to me.
I mean, that you would trust me with your child.
I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been..   trying to have a baby of our own.
You know, I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but..   That you two..    That you two..
This guy?
Seriously?
No, you're all about the fun.
I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?
No.
You both are equally capable.
It's just you're strongest when you're together.
Okay.
So if we both had Emma, and I died..   she'd have to give her up.
Sure.
Monica would have to give her up.
I lie better than that, right?
Let me just get this straight.
So my two friends die, I get Emma.
Then my wife dies.
Then Emma, the one tiny ray of hope left in my life..    gets taken away from me?
There's your movie.
Hey, there you are.
You disappeared after dinner.
Did somebody miss me?
Was there a child to raise poorly?
Ross and Rachel don't know what they're saying.
It's not like they're so responsible.
Emma is a product of a bottle of merlot and a fiveyearold condom.
No, but they're right.
I'm not a strong father figure, and I never will be.
No, you learn these things.
You grow into it.
Yeah, but it's not who I am.
Everything they said is exactly why I was worried about having a kid.
And it's true.
And look, everybody knows it.
I don't know it.
I wanna have a kid with you because I think you'll be an amazing dad.
At the fun parts and at the hard parts.
Well, can you picture me saying, "Go to your room, you're grounded"?
Can you hear me say, "You're grounded"?
You said that to me last week.
How hard is it?
"No shoes on the furniture!"
The producer from Days left a message asking why I wasn't at the parade.
Love you forever.
Love you forever by Robert Munch.
published by Firefly books.
Printed...  in Mexico.
A mother held her new baby  and very slowly rocked him back and forth  Back and forth.
Back and forth.
And while she held him, she sang  "I'll love you forever  I'll like you for always as long as I'm living  my baby you'll be."
And while he rocked her, he sang  "I'll love you forever.
I'll like you for always.
As long as I'm living, my baby you'll be."
Wow!
That was amazing.
Thank you so much for that gift.
I was not ready for this today.
And I can also speak a little French.
Voulezvous coucher avec moi ce soir?
Why?
What did I say?
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Oh, my God.
No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
Knock, knock, knock, knock.
Hi.
Could you please tell Sergei that I was fascinated... ...by what Boutros BoutrosGhali said in the New York Times.
You didn't say "Boutros BoutrosGhali."
Boutros BoutrosGhali.
He says he was too.
Interesting.
So I was wondering... Before you get all talky again... ...could you also please tell Sergei... ...that I really like his suit.
He said, "Thank you."
He thinks you look pretty tonight.
"Your hair, golden like the sun."
So you're a chef?
I'm also thinking of opening up my own restaurant.
Really?
Could I talk to you behind my menu?
What are you doing?
Well, I was having a conversation.
Mischa is so interested in you that Sergei and I... ...haven't been able to say two words to each other.
Do you want me to sit here silently while you three converse?
That would be great.
Thank you.
And the vet said it was time.
And so from half a world away... ...while my mother held the phone to his ear...
...I said goodbye to my dog... ...in seven languages.
Could I have a tissue?
Yeah, sure.
I just hope you don't accidentally... ...suck it up through your nose and choke on it.
Sergei would like to apologize for my behavior tonight.
Well, tell him, "Apology accepted."
He's unbelievable.
For the first time in three years, someone wants to talk to me.
But do you think he would let me enjoy that?
No!
You silly diplomat.
Why don't you learn some English, Sergei.
Excuse me, but isn't he paying for your dinner?
Hey, the man's dog just died.
I have just resigned my post.
Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room?
I have diplomatic coupons.
It would be my pleasure.
My guy has coupons.
Your guy can't even say "coupons."
Plate.
Plate!
Yes!
Plate!
Plate.
See, we don't need them.
Plate?
Yeah.
I like this song.
Well, you're practically dancing already.
Why don't you just do it over here?
You know, it's a very hard language.
Let's do it again
Okay, come on, Rach.It's present time!
You're the glue holdingthis party together.
It's kind of falling apart here.
Oh, look!Wow!
This is from your friends at work.
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, wow!Oh, I know what this is.
Wait a minute.
That can't be right.
Is that a beer bong for a baby?
Darling, that's a breast pump.
Did I say I was done guessing?Okay, thank you for that.
Oh, wow!
What's this?
It's a Diaper Genie.It dispenses clean diapers!
It's where you put dirty ones.
Why don't you take it outsideand throw it in a dumpster?
You're gonna do that 10 times a day?What, it goes 10 times a day?
Are we feeding this baby Indian food?
No, dear.
That's what babies do.
Rachel, listen to your mother.She is very smart.
What will you do with the babywhile you trot out to the garbage?
I don't know,I'd leave it on the changing table?
What?
What did I do?
What did I do?You can't leave a baby alone.
Of course, I know that!
Of course you never leavea baby alone.
It would..She wouldn't be safe.
Not as safe as she would bewith me, the baby dummy.
Opening the presents is a littleoverwhelming right now.
I'm gonna maybe openthem all a little bit later.
Thank you for coming,for the gifts..   and this basket is beautiful.It's actually a bassinet.
Okay, Mommy, don't ever leave me.
Where you going?I'm going to the bathroom.
Now, don't worry.Everything's gonna be okay.
It is gonna be okay!
Worth a shot.
Hey!
Why are you all red and sweaty?
I just Bamboozled Chandler!
Which is not a sexual thing.
Well, that was a quick shower.Not if you were here.
Looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
We did.
My mom gotus the greatest gift of all.
A PlayDoh Barbershop?
No.
She's going to livewith us for eight weeks.
What?
Yes!
She's gonna help ustake care of the baby!
She's a very nice woman,but we can't take eight weeks of her.
She'll drive us crazy..Hi, Ross!
You know what?
Maybe it's notabsolutely vital that you live with us.
Well, Rachel needs help with the baby.I really do.
I don't know anything.
I'm sure that's not true.
Oh, no?Do I know anything about babies?
No.
Not a thing.It's frightening.
Even if she doesn'tknow anything, I do.
I have a son.
His motherand I didn't live together.
When he was with me, I tookcare of him all the time, by myself.
That's true.
You do have another child.Yeah.
With another woman.
Have you no control, Ross?
That's a different issue.
The point is, when the baby comes,I will be there to feed her..   and bathe her and change her.
I want to do all those things.
You don't need me to live with you.Yes!
Yes.
You're gonna be so missed.
You'll be a great father.You'll be a wonderful grandma.
Hello?
I still don't knowwhat the hell I'm doing!
Every firsttime motherfeels that way.
You're gonna pick it up.
Hey, you will.Look, when you first came to the city..   you were a spoiled, helpless littlegirl who used Daddy's credit cards!
I hope you're goingsomewhere with this.
Look at you.You're this big executive.
You are more capablethan you give yourself credit for.
I have no doubt you're gonnabe an incredible mother.
You've been Bamboozled!You're gonna be a terrible mother!
It won't be the same but it will still be Minsk.
Happy New Year.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
You're going to Minsk.
No, I'm not going to Minsk.
Oh, you are so going to Minsk.
You belong in Minsk.
You can't stay here just for me.
Yes, I can.
Because if I go, it means I have to break up with you.
And I can't break up with you.
Oh, yes.
Yes, you can.
Just say, "Phoebe, I love you, but my work is my life.
That's what I have to do now. "
And I say, "Your work?
How can you say that?"
And then you say, "It's tearing me apart but I have no choice.
Can't you understand that?"
And I say, "No!
No!
I can't understand that! "
Sorry.
And then you put your arms around me.
Put your arms around me.
Sorry.
And then you tell me you love me and you'll never forget me.
I'll never forget you.
Then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't want to start the year with me if you can't finish it.
I'm gonna miss you you scientist guy.
In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.
You really didn't have to take me to the airport.
Oh, please.
Every moment is precious.
Besides, someone had to ride with your luggage.
And your friends don't seem to care that you're leaving.
We're not that close.
Okay.
So I guess this is goodbye then.
Oh, no!
It's not goodbye.
I'm not leaving till you get on that plane.
Okay.
Well, I guess it's just "wait here" then.
I need a fake ticket to Yemen.
One ticket?
I just need a pretend ticket.
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.
Okay, what would you give a kid to play with?
Are you traveling with a child?
No.
She'll think I'm handing you a credit card.
But what I'll really hand you is a library card.
A ticket to Yemen is $2100, and we don't take library cards.
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?
Do you have to stay?
American Express?
I can't believe they're doing that!
I told them to go easy on him!
What are these?
Just some pictures I made and hung up.
I thought they'd brighten up the place.
Don't they?
No, don't.
There's no hole there.
I just really like that picture.
Oh, my God!
Look at this!
But there is a wire there!
It's connected to something!
I don't care!
The wires have come loose in your head!
If I could follow the wire, I'd find out what it did.
And did you?
No.
It disappears behind there.
For a minute, I thought it went downstairs.
Say hello to Mrs. Catrokis.
Did that hurt you?
It's worth the pain.
You know what?
It's not.
This is the final boarding call for flight 664 to Yemen.
Well, I guess I gotta go.
My Bingaling.
I'll wait for you.
How long will you be gone?
Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
I'll write you every day.
15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
Okay.
Goodbye.
Janice!
There you are!
I had to have one last kiss.
And also, you said you'd leave after I got on the plane!
No.
I want to see you take off.
Well, then I guess I'm going to Yemen.
I'm going to Yemen!
When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
All right.
The super couldn't figure out what it did.
The $200anhour electrician couldn't figure out what it did.
I've had seven pretty serious shocks.
I give up.
Thank God.
I guess Joey was right.
It does nothing.
See?
I'm doing it!
I am totally doing it!
I lost it
Wow, so I get to see whatJoey Tribbiani is like on a date.
Have any moves?
No, I'm just myself,and if they don't like me for..
I'm sorry, I couldn't evenget through that.
I knew it.
Tell me your moves.
All right.
Well..
I start by having a bottle of winesent to my table from a fan.
Oh, my God.
And that works?
If you add, "This is embarrassing.I just want to have a normal life."
You poor little famous man.
Okay, how about this one?
I was gonna wait until the endof the night to kiss you..   but you're just so beautiful,I don't think I can.
Oh, my God!
Wow, that was fantastic!I almost leaned in.
Really.
So tell me one of your moves.
All right.
So where'd you grow up?
That's your move?
Boy, Rach, you're lucky you're hot.
Come on, just answer the question.Queens.
Were you close to your parents?
With my mom.
Not so much my dad.Why not?
I don't know.There's just this distance.
We both try to pretend it's not there,but it is.
It's gotta be rough.
Yeah, it's really tough.Sometimes I think..   Wow!
Nice move!
"Where'd you grow up?"
So simple.Thank you.
Now, excuse me.I'm gonna use the restroom.
Now you're watching me walk away.Yes, I am!
So simple!
I am not gonna answer that.Oh, come on.
Just pick one.
Between Monica, Phoebe,Chandler and Ross..   if you had to,who would you punch?
We're friends.I wouldn't punch any of them.
Chandler?
Yeah, but I don't know why.
I'm having a wonderful time!Me too!
This is the best date I ever had.I know!
I laughed so hard.
Did yousee the wine come out my nose?
Joey, I think everybody saw it.
I never knew I could enjoythe nonsex part of a date so much.
That's because you have neverbeen on a date with me before.
All right.
Now don't judge me.
I normally wait till my date leaves,but I'm ripping into the swan.
Okay, then you don't judge me.
I'm gonna suck on the cellophanefrom that brownie.
Oh, yeah.
So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani'sendofthenight moves?
Well, if I want the girl to kiss me..   first, I make my lipslook irresistible.
How do you do it?
Now you can't tell anyone, but..
I put on shiny lip balm.
Oh, my God.Like a moth to a flame, I tell you.
Okay, now you go.No, I don't want to tell you.
Why not?It's embarrassing.
More embarrassing thanshiny raspberry lip balm?
I didn't say raspberry before, did I?
Just tell me, Rach.
Just tell me.
Okay.
All right, stand up.
Well, when we're at the door..
I lightly press my lipsagainst his.
Then move into his body,just for a second.
And then I make this sound:   It doesn't sound like anything,but it works.
Oh, yeah.
That would work, yeah.
All right, I gotta go to bed.I had such a wonderful time.
Now, the hadrosaurids have beenunearthed in two main locations.
Monica, listen.
I have to ask.
Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment.
Does he do this with a lot of girls?
Yeah, a lot.
A lot, a lot.
And I'm one of them.
I just cannot believe this.
I mean, Joey Tribbiani.
But, Monica, come on, it's Joey Tribbiani.
I guess you have to.
It's none of my business, but aren't you married?
Yeah.
I wish we could just not be married for a little bit.
You know, I just wish we could be, like, on a break.
Well, you're not.
It's easy for you.
You're not married.
You can have sex with whoever you want.
Yeah, I can.
Don't think I don't.
I do.
I mean, all the time.
You bet!
Monica?
You've done it, right?
Of course I have.
What do you think, I'm, like, some 30yearold virgin?
Oh, my God.
You're a 30yearold virgin.
Say it louder.
The guy in the back didn't hear you.
Yeah, I heard it.
It's not like I haven't had the opportunity.
I'm just waiting for the perfect guy.
I'm seeing this guy Roger.
He's not perfect... but I'm thinking maybe I should get it over with.
You know, give him my flower.
Oh, my God, do it!
Honey, you've waited long enough.
You know what?
You are right.
Sex doesn't have to be a big deal.
There shouldn't be all these rules and restrictions.
People should be able to sleep with whoever they want, whenever.. Rachel, I'm never gonna think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband.
What do you know, virgin?
Phoebe?
You've done all you can, Dr. Wesley.
You've got to let her go.
Goodbye and Godspeed, Hope Brady.
Not so fast, Wesley.
Ramoray!
That's right, Wesley.
I just stopped by to say that you're not a real doctor.
And that woman's brain is fine.
Oh, thank God.
Hope?
Hope?
Drake.
You're not dying, Hope.
You're gonna live a long, healthy life.
With me.
Oh, Drake.
Okay.
Here we go.
Hi, Joey?
It's Rachel.
I am free tomorrow night.
Yeah, sure, sure, I can bring some sandwiches.
So, honey... this threesome thing?
I'll work right here.
This is good.
Next to this plant.
You're in my office.
I've made a lot of cash for this company.
It only takes two heart attacks To finally make you see One of them won't do it But the second will set you free Tell all your hate and anger It's time to say goodbye And that is just what I will do Soon as those bastards I worked for Di
"Gone for more jars.
Back later.
Monica Geller."
Wait a minute.
Look!
What?
Look.
Look.
Look.
What?
What?
What?
It's an empty apartment.
We're all alone in an empty apartment.
Oh, honey, come on.
I have to be at work in, like, ten minutes.
All right.
Well, it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.
There it is!
Oh, that's what you're talking about.
Hey.
Hey.
Do I look fat?
No.
No.
Okay.
I accept that.
When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean... ...that I was calling her a cow.
Okay.
Walk us through it, honey.
Walk us through it.
Okay, well, Janice said, "Hi.
Do I look fat today?"
And I looked at her... Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
You looked at her?
You never look.
You just answer.
It's like a reflex.
"Do I look fat?"
"No."
"Is she prettier than I am?"
"No."
Does size matter?
No!
And it works both ways.
Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
You know, after about 30 or 40 fights, you kind of catch on.
Okay.
For instance: Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options.
Option number one: She'll take a cab home from the airport.
Or option two: You can meet her at baggage claim.
What do you do?
That's easy.
Baggage claim.
Wrong!
Now you're single.
It's actually secret option number three.
You meet her at the gate.
That way she knows you love her.
Okay, this is good.
All right, listen.
I have one.
Janice likes to cuddle... ...at night, which I'm all for.
But when you want to go to sleep, you want some space.
So how do I tell her that without... ...you know, accidentally calling her fat or something?
Oh, honey.
I'm sorry.
We can't help you there, because we're cuddly sleepers.
Okay.
I'm late for work.
All right.
Are you guys going to come down?
Yeah.
I'm right behind you.
Okay.
Good luck, Chandler.
Thank you.
Bye, sweetie.
Bye, honey.
Okay, the sleeping thing.
Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
I thought you were "cuddly sleepers."
No.
No.
Not cuddly.
Not me.
Just her.
I'm like you.
I need the room.
Okay, come here.
Okay.
You're in bed.
Yeah.
I'm gonna use the cushion.
Yeah.
Okay.
You're in bed.
She's over on your side, cuddling.
Now, you wait for her to drift off... ...and then you hug her... ...and roll her over to her side of the bed.
And then you... ...roll away.
Hug for her.
Roll for you.
Okay.
The old "hug and roll."
Okay.
One question.
Shoot.
You're pretending the pillow's a girl, right?
I called the sperm bank today.
They haven't sold a single unit of Tribbiani.
Nobody wants my product.
I mean, I don't get it, you know.
I mean... Maybe if they met me in person.
Honey, you got a little thing on your... Get it?
Yeah.
Hello.
Okay.
Chan, can I talk to you for a second?
Sure.
What's up?
Just one additional relationship thought.
Something you're probably already familiar with.
Women talk
Oh, good, you're here.Pheebs?
Listen..
Sit down, I got something I wanna say.All right.
It's a scary world out there,especially for a single mom.
I've always felt that youand I have a special bond.
So..   Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
Oh, my God!
Oh, yeah, I'll marry you.
You can't marry him!Hey, lady, your day's over.
It's my turn.
Why can't she marry me?I can and I will.
She's not pregnant.Rachel's the one who's pregnant.
Oh, my God!
He'd notice when you didn'thave a baby in nine months!
It's Joey!
I love you.
Wait, I can't believe it!Rachel's pregnant?
Who's the father?
We don't know.
I wonder if it's that dude.There's a dude?
Who is it?
About a month agothis guy spent the night with Rachel.
I didn't see who it was, but..   Was that story over?
The guy left this.
Oh, my God!I know who the father is.
People have gotto finish their stories.
How'd it go?What did Tag say?
Tag is not the father.And Joey knows now?
I do, Rach, I do.And I am so happy for you.
Wow, you didn't even tryto unhook my bra.
So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?I will.
I'm just not up for it tonight.
No matter what this guy says,you're not gonna be alone in this.
I'm not?No.
Listen..
It's a scary world out there,especially for a single mom.
I've always felt like you and I havethis special bond, you know?
Rachel Greene, will you marry me?What?
What?What?!
Pheebs, give me the ring back.No!
Joey, you're so sweet, so sweet, honey.But I'm not looking for a husband.
I understand.
Well, if you'll excuse me,I'm going to go and lie down.
What?
I proposed to you.It balances out.
I can't say that didn't hurt.
But I'll take you back, Joey Tribbiani.
Listen, about that, I only offered..Ooh, a Salami Buddy!
I'm gonna go get these in some water.You stole those from that wedding?
No, the hotel lobby.
They think they cancharge me for some dirty movie..   and a bag of Mashuga Nuts,they got another thing coming!
Hey, my sweater!
I've been looking for thisfor, like, a month.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Hey, how you doing?Good.
Long time no see.
Like your sweater.Right back at you.
It's crazy about Rachel.Well, she's one crazy lady.
So whose is it?I don't know, some Italian guy.
Come on, read your own label.See you later.
He is so weird
Hey, Joey!
Great stuff, huh?
This your place?
Yeah, of course it is.
Come on in.
Go by the window.
You can pretend to be surfing.
I counted.
You're not supposed to live here!
Oh, man!
What happened?
I ended up at Ross' place.
I must have miscounted or something.
Damn!
She's not there anymore.
Look, Ross is doing his "watching TV" bit.
No, Joe, I think he's just watching TV.
Well, I'm not totally back yet, but I appreciate it.
No.
In Ross' building.
She's back!
Wait there.
I'll be over in a second.
One, two, three... Got it!
I gotta check out this hot girl.
There she is!
Damn it!
Did you move?
Yes.
I lived with you for a while.
Then I found this place.
I'm Ross.
Do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
No, I'm all alone.
Yeah.
Sorry about that.
Hey, little girl.
Is your mommy or sister or babysitter, by any chance, a hot girl?
Daddy!
Later, girl!
Oh, man!
Hot girl?
Hot girl!
Hi, Rachel.
You should check this out.
Tell the other tenants.
Apparently, he's looking for some kind of hot girl.
Who isn't?
I don't think we've met.
I'm Ross.
I know.
You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
Never mind.
I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted.
I mean, you had just moved in.
I had just moved in!
Thank you!
Listen... Jen.
I know this may sound a little...
But would you want to grab a cup of coffee sometime?
Sure, that would be nice.
My number's on there.
Give me a call.
I will give you a call.
I'll see you later.
Okay.
I forgot my paper.
Yeah, that's her.
You know, it doesn't matter.
I'll never meet her.
It's impossible to find her apartment!
She lives in some hotgirl parallel universe or something.
What are you talking about?
She lives on the 2nd floor, 7th apartment from the left.
No, she lives on the 3rd floor, 8th apartment from the left.
No.
Those first two windows, that's the lobby.
That other window is the stairway.
You've been counting wrong.
I did not know that!
Thank you, Monica.
I almost lost another girl because of counting!
So you ready?
Yeah, I'll just get my coat.
You know what I just realized?
You made out with Missy Goldberg?
How could you do that after you promised me?
Excuse me.
That didn't make us sound gay at all.
You broke the pact!
Ross, that was 16 years ago.
That doesn't matter.
We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair.
All right, look, if we're really gonna do this,  it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
I didn't.
Oh, really?
No!
Oh, really?No!
Adrienne Turner!
Yes?
Hey, Adrienne.
Hi, Adrienne.
I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
Oh, please and you knew how much I liked her.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Really?
Remember that big party freshman year, a week before Christmas vacation?
I do  You had some visitors.
I can't believe we're at a real college party.
I have to pee so bad.
This is so awesome.
College guys are so cute.
Hey, you've got a boyfriend.
I know.
But if some guy who looks like corey haim wants to kiss me tonight, I am so gonna let him.
Oh, hey, look.
There's Chandler.
You know, that stupid friend of Ross's who said I was fat.
You know, I've already lost four pounds.
You can so totally tell.
I know!
Well, let's see, maybe he knows where Ross is.
Hey, how's it going?
Aren't you...  yeah, Rachel.
And this is Ross's sister monica.
We met at thanksgiving.
Right.
So, how you doing?
Bitchin'.
Hi, Monica.
Hi, Chandler.
It's really nice to see you.
Not.
Okay.
I'll see if I can find Ross.
Oh, my god, Rach, beanbag chairs.
Do not let me sit in one of those.
We'll be here for days.
Listen, Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this.
Oh, believe me, Ross, I won't be telling anybody about this.
Cool.
I didn't know you knew about that.
Well, I did, and it hurt.
That's when I wrote the song, "betrayal in the common room."
man, I...
I'm sorry.
Look... it was a long time ago.
So, uh...
I made out with Adrienne, and you made out with Missy.
Well, I guess we're even.
Mmhmm.
We are even, right?
Just one more thing.
I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you,  so I thought, who does Ross like more than anybody?
What did you do to my mom?
Not her.
I am so drunk.
That's weird I've had the same number of beers as you, and I don't feel anything at all.
So, you girls having fun?
For your information, ass munch...
...I've lost four pounds.
Maybe even five, with all the dancing.
Did somebody order a pizza?
Oh, that's me!
I am so not gonna do good on my SATs tomorrow.
Well, maybe you could go to school here next year, and we could totally hang out.
Oh, yeah, there's a plan.
Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now.
Well, maybe you could get in on a beauty scholarship.
What a line.
So, where are you applying to?
Um, well, you know, I think it's kind of really important  that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of... hey!
I'm in college, and I'm in a band.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, ye ... this is so weird.
It's been an hour, and not one of my classmates has shown up?
I tell you, when I actually die, some people are gonna get seriously haunted.
There you go.
Someone came.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm gonna go hide.
This is so exciting.
My first mourner!
Hi.
Glad you could come.
Please come in.
Hi.
You're Chandler Bing, right?
I'm Tom Gordon.
I was in your class.
Oh, yes.
Yes, let me take your coat.
Thanks.
I'm so sorry about Ross, it's..   No, at least he died doing what he loved.
Watching blimps.
Who is it?
You know some guy, Tom Gordon?
I don't remember him.
But then again, I touched so many lives.
So did you know Ross well?
Actually, I barely knew him.
I came because I heard Chandler's news.
Do you know if he's seeing anyone?
Yes, he is.
Me.
What?
You mean..?
Can I ask you a personal question?
How do you shave your beard so close?
Okay, Tommy!
That's enough mourning for you.
Here we go Byebye.
All right.
Hey, listen.
Call me.
Okay.
I'm dead and no one cares?
I look like a man?
Please, one ridiculous problem at a time.
This isn't ridiculous.
Look around, no one's here.
You gave them one day's notice.
Not everyone checks the website every day.
And Monica, it's probably the way you stand!
I guess you're right.
Still, somebody must have seen it.
I went to that school for four years and I didn't have an impact on anyone?
Well, that's not true.
You had an impact on me.
I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends.
Doesn't that count for something?
Oh, great, more party boys for Chandler.
I'm sure it's somebody for you.
Now go hide.
Hi.
I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.
Kori?
Kori Weston?
Yeah.
You look amazing.
And you are?
Chandler.
Chandler Bing.
And I'm not gay.
I'm not gay at all.
You are married, though.
Don't listen to him.
He's in a really bad mood.
I can't believe that Ross is gone.
It is just so sad.
I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
Oh, we weren't.
But we had one class together.
He was such a great guy.
And he talked so passionately about science.
I always remembered him.
I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.
And if heaven has a door..
I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out.
I guess I really missed my chance.
No, you didn't!
I'm still alive!
Who did we bury?
Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you.
It's a long story.
But the things you just said really made my day.
The fact that you're here means more to me..   than if this room were filled with people.
You sick freak!
Who does that?
I can't believe I had a crush on you.
Did you hear that?
Kori Weston had a crush on me!
No, Mom, I am not dead.
I know it's not something to kid about.
It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, okay?
Actually, no.
Even if I had died, you would not be left childless.
Monica
Ooh, ooh, because she's my exwife and will probably want to bring her ooh, ooh, lesbian lifepartner.
Is Carol here?
No, she's at a faculty meeting.
I just came by to pick up my skull.
Well, not mine, but.
Come in.
Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
What's it look like?
Kind of like a big face without skin.
I'm familiar with the concept.
You can just look for it.
You guys sure have a lot of books about being a lesbian.
You know, you have to take a course.
Otherwise they don't let you do it.
Yertle the Turtle!
A classic.
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
The baby that hasn't been born yet?
Wouldn't that mean you're crazy?
What?
You don't think they can hear sounds in there?
You're not serious?
I mean you really talk to it?
Yeah, all the time.
I want the baby to know my voice.
Do you talk about me?
All the time.
Really?
We just refer to you as "Bobo, the sperm guy. "
If she's talking to it, I just think I should get some bellytime too.
Okay, here we go.
Where am I talking to here?
There is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but.
Just aim for the bump.
Okay, here goes.
You know, I can't do this.
It's too weird.
I feel stupid.
It's fine.
You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
Hello, baby!
And everyone's telling me, "You gotta pick a major! "
So on a dare, I picked paleontology.
And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus.
You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
You don't have to talk to it.
You can sing to it.
Please.
I am not singing to your stomach.
How's it going?
Here we come Walking down the street Get the funniest looks from Everyone we meet Hey, hey.
Did you feel that?
I did.
Does it always?
That was the first!
Keep singing!
Keep singing!
Hey, hey, you're my baby And I can 't wait to meet you When you come out I'll buy you a bagel And then we'll go to the zoo I felt it that time!
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy I'm the one without any breasts Not that one.
The selection committee has chosen the three of you as our finalists today.
The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers you give to the questions I ask here.
I'm gonna start with Dr. Li.
Dr. Li, you claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system.
How do you propose to correct this problem?
Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological evidence.
I plan to begin there.
/ Interesting.
I guess!
Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work.
Where might that take place?
Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota.
Certainly.
Very well.
And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?
What?
I...
I...  Care to venture a guess?
May 12th?
That's not even kinda close!
Dr. Li, how many graduate students you'd be needing?
Half a dozen.
I see, and Dr. Biely?
Three for excavation and two for analysis.
Certainly.
Dr. Geller,  which 1965 Shirelles hit was later covered by a popular British invasion band?
Wha..?
I need 6 graduate students.
No!
I'm sorry, we were looking for "Baby It's You".
Baby It's You.
Wha...?
Wait, wait, wait, just a minute.
None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.
You're right, I apologize.
Scratch the last question.
Spell "Mboscodictiosaur".
um...
I've never heard of a "Mboscodictiosaur".
Yeah, I just made it up.
Spell it.
Ok!
b.o.m  No, it starts with a silent "M".
Oh come on!!
I can't believe Joey.
Your exboyfriend is insane.
Did you get the grant?
No I didn't, and you want to know why?
Because your exboyfriend is still in love with you.
What?
Yeah.
He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up.
Benji isn't in love with me.
I mean, he broke up with me.
And besides, he's a very ethical man.
Really?
Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review,  who was the voice of "Underdog"?
I'm sure he was just joking, Ross  If you don't believe me,  let's go talk to him, okay?
I'm telling you,  He didn't ask me one paleontological question.
Seriously?
Oh, I'm sorry, no.
He did ask me one?
Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?
Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then MBO...
Damn it!
Dr. Geller...?
Charlie... What are you...  what are you doing here?
I want you to tell her everything.
About the deal you tried to make with me,  about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox!
That's the voice of Underdog!
Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.
No, no, no.
Don't do that!
I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.
Benji?
Alright, it's true.
I behaved horribly.
But it's only because I still love you.
And I would do anything to have you back in my life.
Too little, too late, Benji!
I can't believe this.
I never should have broken up with you.
I think about you all the time.
I mean, do you ever still think about me?
No!
Yes!
What?
I don't know what to say, Benji.
This is all so.... romantic.
or...
Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here,  but is there any chance you will take me back?
Maybe...  Sweetie, this conversation is starting  to make me a little uncomfortable.
Oh God!
I am so sorry, but...I mean it's...  there's so much history between us, you know...
I'm sorry too...
I love you!
/ I love you too!
Okay, that's it.
WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!
Do you have a minute?
I was just about to take a break anyway.
So listen...
...I know we haven't had a chance to talk... ...since Emily and I decided to get married.
And I was just wondering how you were.
If you were getting married, I would feel kind of... You know?
It definitely took me by surprise.
But, you know...
...I'm okay.
I just wanted to check.
That's sweet.
Thank you.
You're great.
And I know someday this will happen for you too.
You just hang in there.
"Hang in there"?
No, I didn't mean... You haven't heard of a serious relationship called "me and Joshua"?
I thought you had just been on four dates.
I didn't realize that had become anything.
Oh no, it has become.
Oh no, those were four great dates.
I mean, and the connection!
Emotionally, mentally.
You know?
Physically.
That's incredible.
I know, isn't it?
I'm right there with Joshua.
You are right there with Emily.
And it's kind of like it's a tie.
I gotta get back to my dishes.
I gotta get to work.
You know what would make me happy?
You know, what's that?
If the four of us could all, you know, hang out together.
Emily's coming into town this weekend.
Why don't we all have dinner Sunday night?
That would be great!
All right.
It's a date!
"Hang in there."
You hang in there.
Did you say something?
I hear you and Joshua are going out with Ross and Emily.
I think that's really cool.
I think you're handling that really well.
"Handling it"?
There's nothing to handle.
Maybe I'd have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua.
They're not going to get married anyway.
They rushed into this thing so fast, it's ridiculous!
They'll be engaged for like what?
A year?
One of them will realize what they've done... ...and call it off.
You'll be dancing at my wedding before you dance at theirs.
You know, I don't dance at weddings.
Why not?
Weddings are a great place to meet women.
When I dance, I look like this.
Hey, man.
What are you doing four weeks from today?
Nothing.
Nothing.
I am... ...free.
Because we're getting married in a month.
What?
Yes.
In a month?
You mean 30 days?
Yeah.
From now?
That's great!
She always wanted to get married where her parents did... ...but it's getting torn down.
I know it's crazy, but everything's been so crazy... ...and it just feels right.
Hey, that's the day after I start menstruating!
This isn't mine.
Well, you'd better make it for three.
Dude, they're all huge!
They're no bigger than me.
You're closer to you.
So you look bigger to you from where you are.
I'm going to go say "hello."
I kind of liked it.
I know what to do.
I've got to go Red Ross.
You know, Red Ross?
Totally don't know.
That time we were in line for Dances With Wolves... ...and that guy cut in front of us and I just lost it?
Screamed at him, turned all red!
Red Ross!
You'll see!
Liam, do me a favor.
Go easy on Ross.
It's his first time.
You don't say?
Good luck, babe.
Come on, get in here!
Come on!
Come on, get in the bloody scrum!
I can't believe they're doing that!
I told them to go easy on him!
No offense, but sometimes it's hard to understand you, with the accent.
That's just halftime.
There's more.
Did you see me?
I was pretty good.
That is one fun game!
Do me a favor?
Grab me some water?
Thanks!
I think I'm dying.
I really do.
Poor baby!
Tell my son that I love him.
Excellent!
Got to have some more fun!
They are killing you.
That's not true.
She's right.
You have to stop!
No!
I'm not stopping.
I'm Red Ross!
Dude, you go back out there, you'll be Dead Ross.
I'm not quitting.
I'm going to finish this game.
If you insist on it, at least let me help you.
It's no place for a woman.
Those guys will grab anything!
That's not it.
I just know a few things that can help you inflict pain.
I like that.
Listen closely.
Devon has got a weak ankle.
One swift kick and he'll back off.
Bad ankle.
Got it!
And that big bloke with the beard?
He's got a trick hip.
And David over there, he doesn't wear a cup.
I could use that.
Trick hip, no cup.
Okay!
And Liam's got bad knees.
Hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp.
But Liam's on my team.
I don't care.
Just get him!
Go and get him!
I am going back in!
Red Ross!
Yeah!
What are these?
No, that'll just bring me down!
This was great!
I was great!
This was a great day!
I'm buying everyone coffee.
Just grab my wallet.
It's in my pocket.
No, not you.
Your eye's still popping out.
I'll go get some ice.
Ice, yeah!
I'm so in the mood for ice.
You were amazing out there.
I kind of was, wasn't I?
Oh, my God!
I made a man twice my size cry!
I haven't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.
You really enjoyed yourself, didn't you?
Are you kidding?
I hurt three huge men.
I gave a guy a bloody nose!
I'm not proud of it... ...but I really am!
And it's all because of you.
Wonderful, amazing you.
I think you've got a concussion.
No, I'm serious.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I'm sorry.
Did that hurt you?
It's worth the pain.
You know what?
It's not.
This is the final boarding call for flight 664 to Yemen.
So I understand you're looking for a place?
No, I'm staying put.
I was going to offer you my apartment.
Why?
Where you going?
I don't know.
You won't believe it.
Monica and Chandler are moving in again.
That's great news, right?
I mean, for them, right?
But on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
Yeah.
You know, about that...
I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything... but don't you think it'll be weird?
Why?
Why would it... Why would it be weird?
Well, you know, because of us.
Because of our history.
No!
No, no!
It would only be weird if we were still in "that place."
Are you still in that place?
No, not at all.
Good.
Me neither.
So it's not a problem.
We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
Okay, but eventually you and I will be dating.
Really?
We are?
Yeah.
I'll have a boyfriend and you'll have a girlfriend.
That'd be great.
But if you think it'll be okay, we'll just work out a system.
It'll be like in college.
I'll hang a sign on the door: "Come back later.
I'm getting lucky."
Yeah, I didn't think of that.
I found you in my bed How'd you wind up there?
You are a mystery Little black curly hair Little black, little black, little black Little black curly hair If you want to receive emails about my upcoming shows... please give me money so I can buy a computer.
Where are the other guys?
Well, Monica and Chandler are occupied.
Fighting?
The other thing.
It's great they worked things out.
There's no breaking them up, is there?
Can I borrow the key to your house so I can go make a copy?
Here.
Thank you.
Are you sure?
Once I make a copy, there's no turning back.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Now get out of here before I change my mind.
You think moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
I've been back and forth.
Well, maybe you should go back.
She moves in, and before you know it... you're right where you don't want to be, back together.
I don't think so.
She's already talking about dating other guys.
That's not going to work out.
She'll come home all weepy... and you'll be telling her, "Oh, that's okay.
You'll find someone."
And then, bam!
She finds you!
Maybe you're right.
Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again.
Is that what you want?
Is that what I want?
Yes.
Here she comes.
I'm gonna make your life much easier.
The place was closed, so I'll copy it later.
Or not.
Why don't you move in with me?
Whoa, Joey!
Look, I know I scared you with that whole nakedThursdays thing... but we don't have to do that.
It would be easier to move across the hall.
Unless you're thinking about naked Wednesdays.
Thursday's clearly not good for you.
Pick a day!
Come on in.
Okay, guys.
All right!
Bring it on, you!
Here we go.
You know, I've never played my stuff for anyone before.
So it's important that you understand... ...it's about communicating... ...very private emotions.
You know... You should think of my work... ...as wordless sound poems.
That's what Oh, my God, play.
Well, you know, that was... ...terrific!
Really... ...bitchen.
Wow!
It was so wow!
Really?
Yeah!
I mean, you should play in public.
Wow, thanks, you guys.
That's I want to play you another piece.
I left my helicopter sounds on another disk.
I'll be right back, okay?
This is so nice.
I mean, I am so... God bless my dad for soundproofing the basement.
I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
What are you guys talking about?
I loved it!
It was so moving.
It's so different from the stuff you usually hear.
You mean, music?
Electrifying Infinite time There's a Starbucks about three blocks down.
He's so inspired.
Just look at him.
Look at him go!
Thank you very much!
The place has emptied because of him.
Oh, my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time.
I'd give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
Oh, my God!
He's lost it.
He's totally lost it.
What?
This cannot get any worse.
Rats in the basement are hanging themselves.
Thank you.
Thanks.
I lost it.
I won't play anymore.
Would you?
Can you finish my set?
After that?
Yeah.
No, I mean, if I can help.
Yeah, like I could lose it.
What?
I played bad on purpose, guys.
Okay, you were trying to play bad this whole time.
No.
Just that last song
I can't believe she's dating!
What did you think she was gonna do?I don't know.
I can't believe this is happening.What do you mean?
I thought when I had another kid,it'd be different.
I love Ben.
But every timeI drop him off at Carol and Susan's..   it breaks my heart a little.
I've always had this pictureof me and my next wife in bed..   my kid comes running in, leaps upon the bed and we all read the paper.
Maybe fight over the science section.
That's nice.
You can still have that.No.
Rachel's out with some guy.
My baby went with her.
If anything, that picturekeeps moving further away.
Hey, can I ask you something?
In this picture of you and your wife,is your wife Rachel?
It used to be.
Now she doesn't really have a face.
Smokin' body, though.
Good call.
But the face, Ross,the face isn't Rachel.
No.
But how much easier would it beif it were?
That's not what she wants.
I know.
And I can't force myselfto fall in love with her.
Ross, maybe you need a new picture.
It won't be what you thought.But no matter what..   there's gonna bea brandnew little baby.
Your baby.
Who cares what the picture looks like?
Yeah.
Let's you and me go outand have some fun.
Whatever you want.
Come on.
We can catch that Ukrainian film.No, I said fun.
Hey, Toby?Hey, Bobby.
Hello.Hi.
How was the date?
I'm alone and I just bought $15 worthof candy bars.
What do you think?
What happened?I told him I was pregnant.
He didn't take it so well?Well, better than you.
But still not what you want.Oh?
Yeah.
He got all weird and sputtery.Then he said:   "I hear those hemorrhoidsare a bitch."
He sounds swell.Doesn't he?
You want a little cheering up?Sit down.
Guess whose middle name is Muriel.
Chandler M. Bing.Oh, my God.
I'm sorry about your date.It's all right.
I guess I'm just donewith the dating thing.
Just one more thing in my lifethat's completely different.
This is hard.Yeah, I know.
On the other hand, in seven monthsyou're gonna have something..   that you're gonna love more thanany guy you've ever gone out with.
Just wait.
Wait until the first timeyour baby grabs your finger.
You have no idea.
Thanks, sweetie.
You wanna grab some coffee?No.
I'm gonna go eat 10 candy bars.
I thought I cheered you up.You did.
There are 20 in here.
Good night.Good night.
Ross?
Hey, it's Mona.From the wedding.
Oh, hi!Hi.
How are you?I'm good, except you owe me a dance.
That's right.
Well, would you beinterested in seeing a Ukrainian film?
Oh, you're serious.
Sure.
Great.
Well..
I think I need another cup of coffee.Sure, let me get it for you.
Bob?
Bob!
Bob!
What the hell are you doing?This is Chandler's office.
Just so you know, Dr. Long can't be heretoday, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.
Oh, okay.Can I ask you a question?
Was it me, or was the guywho took my blood sample really cute?
You know who I'm talking about?Bowl haircut, hairy fingers?
Hi, Rachel?
I'm Dr. Schiff.Yes, you are.
Okay, now he's cute, right?Oh, God, yes.
So, how's it going?
It's going really good.But enough about me!
Come on.
Where are you from?What do you do?
I'm a doctor.Right.
I meant..   in your spare time.Do you cook?
So you ski?
Or just hang out with your wife,or girlfriend?
I don't have a wife or a girlfriend,but I do like to ski.
I love to ski!How amazing is this?
Are you experiencing any discomfort?No, I'm very comfortable.
Any painful gas?No!
Dr. Schiff!What kind of question is that?
Okay, then.
Would you liketo lie down on the table?
Would you like meto lie down on the table?
Is there something going on here?Do you feel it too?
Hi.How did your doctor's appointment go?
Well, let's see,they gave me "cute boy" doctor today.
In the middle of the exam,I put my pinkie in his chin dimple.
Oh, my God!Why did you do that?
Remember that little problem I was havingduring my fourth month of pregnancy?
Oh, yeah!The Evander Holyfield phase.
Oh, man!
You were so hard up,you practically came on to me.
You wish.
Hey, I could have had youif I wanted you.
Oh, yeah?
Come and get it.
Okay, even this is turning me on.You guys, I got problems.
Oh, hey.
Hey, Ross!How's it going with you and Mona?
Are you guys still together?
I'd like to order a pizza.Can I ask you a question?
Is the cute blond guy delivering tonight?Very "Abercrombie & Fitch."
I'll call you back.Who was that?
It's just the pizza place.You hung up on the pizza place?
I don't hang up on your friends.
Sorry, honey, I'm just having a rough day.What's wrong?
You don't want to hear about it.Then why did I ask?
Okay, this is really embarrassing, butlately, with this whole pregnancy thing..
I'm just finding myself..   How do I put this?
Erotically charged.
Is that college talk for "horny"?
Yeah.
I have all of these feelings,and I don't know what to do about them.
I can't date like a normal person, which isfine because I don't need a relationship.
All I really want is one great night!Just sex.
No strings attached.No relationship.
With someone I feel comfortable with,and who knows what he's doing.
For just one great night.I mean, is that really so hard..   to find?
So how was your day?
Good.
I saw a pretty big pigeon.
Well, I gotta get up early,and it's almost 7:00.
I gotta go to my room.Good night!
Good night!
I can't do it!I didn't ask you to do it!
You're Rachel!You're Joey!
You're my friend!Right back at you.
Yeah.
Plus, it would be wrong,and weird and bad!
So bad!
But I don't know what you're talkingabout.
I didn't ask you to do anything!
I know!
You wanna do it?No!
I'm just testing you!Well, that's the end of this conversation!
This conversation never happened!Never happened!
Get back in there!
Listen, I'm sorry aboutthat whole thing with Roger.
Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?
Well, now I do!
I'm sorry.
Seven years!
I mean, we've been together seven years.
She's the only woman who's ever loved me.
She's the only woman I've ever... Oh, Ross.
This is nice.
I know.
It is, isn't it?
No, I mean it.
This feels really good.
Is it a hundred percent cotton?
Yeah.
And I got it on sale too.
I mean, it looks nubby, but...
But it's not.
Anyway, I should go.
One of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
If you want to get a drink later, we can.
That sounds great.
Oh, and listen, it's gonna be...
I know.
Thanks.
Maybe this wouldn't have happened if I'd been more nurturing... ...or I'd paid more attention... ...or I had a uterus.
I can't believe it.
I know.
You know, you don't deserve this.
You don't, Ross.
You're really... You're so good.
Thanks.
And you're so sweet.
Thanks.
And you're kind.
Thanks.
Come here.
Wait, wait, wait.
Okay.
It's okay.
Wait, wait, wait!
My foot is stuck in the pocket.
What?
What?
I can't get it out.
That's not something a girl wants to hear.
Come on, don't start.
What?
Stupid balls are in the way.
Oh, well.
That probably wouldn't have been the most constructive solution.
You have chalk on your face.
Oh, Ross, you're right.
I don't know why I always thought this was real grass.
Honey, you okay?
My wife's a lesbian.
Cool!
Ross, Joey.
Joey, Ross.
Hey.
How's it going?
I can't believe you came back.
Don't say anything.
I don't wanna speak.
I don't wanna think.
I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here... ...right now.
Rachel.
Rachel!
What?
You missed the exit.
Oh.
Sorry.
My God, what were you thinking about?
Barry
I thought it'd be a closed casket.
Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice.
Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
I don't see why not.
Here's my retainer!
I was just thinking when my time comes.
Dad!
Listen to me!
When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.
You what?
I wanna be buried at sea.
It looks like fun.
Define "fun. "
Come on.
You'll make a day of it.
You'll get a boat, pack a lunch.
And then we throw your body in the water.
Gee, that does sound fun.
Everyone thinks they know me.
Everyone says, "Jack Geller, so predictable. "
Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say, "Buried at sea?
Huh. "
That's probably what they'll say.
I'd like that.
Hey, gorgeous.
Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.
This one?
I've shown you every dress we have.
Unless you want her to spend eternity in a lemonyellow pantsuit go with the burgundy.
Whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.
You're right.
We'll go with the burgundy.
A fine choice.
I'm coming out.
Wait!
We need shoes.
How about these?
That's really a day shoe.
And where she's going, everyone else will be dressier?
Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy.
I can show you something in a silver that may work.
No, it really should be burgundy.
Unless we go with a different dress.
No, no, no.
Watch this.
Wait, I may have something in the back.
Oh, my God.
Would things have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
What's the matter?
Some mean guys at the coffeehouse took my hat.
No!
You're kidding?
It was ridiculous.
These guys were bullies.
Actual bullies.
We're grownups.
This kind of stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.
Oh, no, wait a minute.
I have no one.
Let's go down there and get your hat back.
Forget it.
It's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.
We did it.
We're here.
We are standing our ground.
How long does coffee take?
Would you come on?
Come on!
Thank you.
There we go.
I think we proved our point.
You burn your mouth?
Cannot feel my tongue.
Bullies!
Big bullies!
Look who's here.
It's the weenies.
Did we not make ourselves clear the other day?
That's why we're here.
Yes, we're standing our ground.
Apparently.
Let's do this already.
You got a weapon?
A nice watch.
I don't want to break it on your ribs.
All right, let's do this.
Question: If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
What do you mean?
It's sharp, it's metal.
I think I can do some serious damage with it.
No, you can't use your watch.
Or your keys.
Here's what we'll do.
We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there.
All right?
All right, come on, man.
Let's do it!
Before I forget, are we hitting faces?
Of course.
Why wouldn't you hit faces?
I have to work on Monday.
I have a big presentation.
Actually, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow... ...and this nofaces thing might not be a bad idea.
Nothing from the neck up.
Or the waist down.
Dana's ovulating.
Really?
You guys trying again?
Let me get this straight.
We're talking about the middle?
Come on!
You want a piece of this?
I'm standing here!
Those guys are taking our stuff!
God, that was amazing.
That was incredible.
You guys kicked butt!
Us?
What about you guys?
You really gave it to old Mr. Clean back there.
He was a big guy.
Yeah, he was, wasn't he?
I wouldn't know, having missed everything.
Don't do that to yourself.
Any one of us could have tripped over that little girl's jump rope.
So listen, guys... ...are we okay here?
We're okay.
So can I have my hat back?
Oh, my God.
Look at her.
Hi, Monica!
How's it going?
Hey, nice boobs.
Guys, guys.
Check this out.
Happy Thanksgiving.Will, I'm so glad that you came.
You look great.
You must've lost..   150 pounds.
I'll be on one of thoseSubway commercials.
A pie!It's no fat, no sugar, no dairy.
It's no good.
Throw it out.Meet some people.
This is my husband, Chandler.This is Will.
Oh, hey.
I'd shake your handbut I'm really into the game.
Plus, it'd be better for my egoif we didn't stand next to each other.
This is Phoebe.Hi.
Hey.
Wow!
Well done.
Wanna give me a hand?I can't get over how great you look.
You look incredible too.
You're so fit.I'm watching the game, but I'm not deaf.
I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.Great, I love Ross.
Good.
And Rachel Greene too.
Is there a problem?No.
It's okay.
It's just.. God, I hated her.
What?I hated her.
She was horrible to me in high school.
But hey, that was a long time ago.
I'm ina good place.
Might be fun to see her again.
Got any cakes or cookiesor something?
No, Will!
No!
It's been a while since we screamed.Maybe we should.
Oh, okay.
Want some chips?No.
Will!Ross!
Hey, you came!Man, you look incredible!
You too.
So, what are you up to?
I'm a commodities broker.That sounds interesting.
Yeah, it's not.Oh.
But I'm rich and thin.Oh.
I haven't seen you sinceLance Davis' graduation party.
That was such a fun night.
Would've been good if we hadgotten in, but still fun.
We were lame.
Do you rememberhow into dinosaurs we were?
Yeah.So, what do you do now?
So how long are you in town?
Hi.Hey, sweetie.
Oh, good.
Rachel Greene.
Oh, that's right.Are you gonna be okay?
Oh, I'll be fine.
It's just..God, I hate her, Ross!
I hate her!
High school was a long time ago.
Look at her standing therewith those yams.
My two greatest enemies: Rachel Greeneand complex carbohydrates.
Oh, my God.
Who is that?
That's Will, from high school.Oh!
I do not remember him.
Wow, really got that sexysmoldering thing going on.
Oh, my God.
Look at the wayhe's just staring at me.
He's trying to mouth something to me.
I hate you!
Okay, dinner's ready!Okay!
Solid effort.
Solid effort.Oh, so who won?
Green Bay.Detroit.
What?The Lions technically won.
But it was a moral victoryfor the Green Bay Mermen.
Hi!
Will, right?Right, hi.
I'm Rachel Greene.
Oh, I remember you.Really?
Aren't you sweet?
I gotta tell you, I'm havingthe hardest time placing you.
Hang on!
I think I remember you.
Did we fool around atLance Davis' graduation party?
You are unbelievable.Thank you.
But you worked so hard.
That's what I did to kids in my building.
No, it's a water balloon fight.
We started it.
I stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight.
It's excellent.
The director is.. Who drank all the kamikazes?
Could I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, sure.
So this play, what do you think?
It's gotten great reviews..
Attack!
Put your balloons down!
Weren't you going out with Elizabeth?
I was.
She was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
Sometimes grownups have commitments they can't get out of.
Maybe she is too young for me.
When I was over there, I felt like I was a babysitter.
I see what you were talking about.
I don't know what to do.
Weigh the good stuff about her against the bad.
That's what I did when I first started... weighing stuff.
Okay, bad stuff.
I'm 12 years older than she is.
The school could fire you.
She's leaving for three months.
For camp.
Okay, good stuff.
Well, she's sweet and pretty and.. And the sex is probably great, huh?
The only thing you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?"
Do you see yourself marrying her?
My God.
You married her, didn't you?
No, I didn't do that.
It's just...
Okay, honestly, no.
I don't see a big future with her.
Okay, I think that's your answer.
I gotta talk to her.
I hate this part.
Forget Elizabeth.
If you're not careful... you may not get married at all this year.
I have never had such a healthy breakup.
She was such a grownup about it.
She didn't seem too immature for me.
Did I just make a huge mistake?
Ross!
Wait!
Elizabeth, thank God.
I was just thinking about.. You suck!
I'm gonna write "Joey" on one napkin... and "Ross" on the other napkin and we're gonna pick one.
I know it's not what you want to hear, but I can't help it.
I love marriage.
Seriously, you?
"Divorceo"?
If you have to call me a name, I'd prefer "Ross, the Divorcer."
It's just cooler.
Look, I know my marriages didn't exactly work out..   but, you know, I loved being that committed to another person.
And Carol and I had some good times before she became a lesbian.
And once afterward.
Anyway, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
That's how you feel.
But, come on, I mean, living together will be great.
I mean, you guys have so much fun.
And you love Mike.
I do love Mike.
Yeah, see?
And you were so excited about moving in together before..   and you know what, you should be.
It's a big deal.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Yeah, thanks.
This helped.
Thanks.
The Divorcer to the rescue.
It's not cooler.
Yeah, I just heard it.
Hey.
Hey, what do you guys think about this: Ross, the Divorce Force.
Better.
Yeah?
Very cool.
Hey, Phoebe?
You know, I'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day..    and I hope I was a little helpful.
Yeah, you were helpful.
Yeah.
No, thank you.
Good.
Good.
Because the more I thought about it, the more I realized..
I don't think marriage is necessarily the right path for you.
What do you mean?
I know the other day in the coffeehouse..   you were all caught up in the whole soccermom thing..   but is that really you?
I mean, can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?
They are awfully boxy.
People like me like stability and security.
I mean, I don't know, you'd be so bored with marriage.
I mean, it's so normal.
Yeah.
Hey, can I help?
Well, we climbed up four flights of stairs, maneuvered a narrow hallway..   dodged a rabid pit bull.
But these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.
You know, sometimes your words, they hurt.
Hey, where do you guys want this?
Yeah, seriously, because this is really heavy.
I mean, not for me, because I'm only pretending to hold it, but for these guys.
Just one last time on the marriage thing.
There's no wiggle room?
None at all?
No, but you don't want to get married either, right?
Right.
Except that I do want to get married.
Couldn't have had this conversation down at the truck, huh?
What?
You want to get married?
Someday.
And.. hernia.
I haven't had a normal life.
And I never felt like I was missing out on anything.
But it feels like now it's my turn to have some of the regular stuff.
Why didn't you say something before?
I didn't know how much I wanted it.
And I love you, and I wanted to live with you.
I want to live with you too.
I mean, let's do that.
But I don't think I can.
It was okay to move in when I didn't know what was gonna happen.
But I can't move in knowing nothing is ever gonna happen.
I said to bring the cushions up first, but no.
Can we at least try living together?
You might change your mind about marriage.
Are you gonna change yours?
No.
Me neither.
I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.
But I don't want this to end.
No, I don't want it to end either.
I can't believe this is gonna end.
I guess I'll have my stuff picked up.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay, so..   Goodbye.
Take it easy, Mike.
Bye, Mike.
I'm so sorry, Phoebe.
We're all sorry.
Look on the bright side.
At least you won't have to live with this ugly chair.
That was here already, huh?
I love you.
I did it!
Oh, look!
It's the woman we ordered.
Can we help you?
No, thanks.
I'm just waiting for Joey Tribbiani.
I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Oh, no, not you.
Big Joey.
Oh, my God!
You're so much cuter than your pictures.
I'm Ronni.
Cheese nip?
Joey's having an embolism but I'd go for a nip.
Most people, when their pets pass on want them laid out like they're sleeping.
Occasionally you get a person who wants them in a pose.
Like chasing their tail.
Or jumping to catch a Frisbee.
Joey, if I go first, I want to be looking for my keys.
That's a good one!
Hey, Dad.
Ronni's here.
Hello, babe!
What are you doing here?
You left your hair at my place.
I thought you'd need it for your meeting.
Thank you.
So!
Who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
Look, I. I shouldn't have come.
I gotta go.
I'll miss the last train.
I don't want you taking that thing this late.
Where am I gonna stay?
Here?
We'll go to a hotel.
No, you won't.
No, we won't.
If you go to a hotel, you'll be doing stuff.
I want you right here, where I can keep an eye on you.
You're gonna keep an eye on us?
Right, mister!
I don't care how old you are, while you're here you're gonna live by my rules.
And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
Wow, he's strict.
Dad, you'll be in my room.
Ronni, you can stay in Chandler's room.
Thanks.
You're a good kid.
Come on.
I'll show you to my room.
That sounds weird when it's not followed by, "No, thanks, it's late! "
This is just for tonight.
Starting tomorrow, you gotta change.
Six years is long enough!
What kind of change?
Break up with Ronni.
I can't!
Then come clean with Ma!
This is not right!
I don't wanna hear it!
Now go to my room!
Hey, kickie!
May I help you?
Joey said I could use your shower since Chandler's in ours.
Who are you?
Oh, I'm Ronni.
Ronni Rapalono.
The mistress?
Come on in.
Thanks.
I'm Rachel.
Bathroom's up there.
Say, Ronni.
How long has Chandler been in the shower?
Like five minutes.
Perfect.
Fasten your seat belts it's peepee time!
Hey, Mr. Trib.
Good morning, dear.
Chandler Bing, it's time to see your thing.
What's with you?
I thought it was Chandler!
You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
Sorry, my thing was in there with me.
That was so cool, man.
The way you leaned on that guy.
It is starting to get dark out there.
He told you everything.
You cracked him.
He was the victim.
They're usually pretty talkative.
Okay, but it is officially nighttime.
Want me to grab the berry for you?
It's called a cherry.
It's called Chandler!
Okay, I got it.
This place makes the best sandwich in the world.
Does it have meatballs?
Oh, yeah.
Melted cheese and marinara sauce?
Yep.
You can't eat that in my car.
Yeah, okay.
Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
Your tax dollars?
Yeah, okay.
Wow, that sandwich smells good.
Did I say you could smell it?
I can't smell it?
Half the taste is in the smell.
You're sucking up all the taste units.
Okay, I'll give them back.
What is so great about that sandwich?
Imagine the best sex you ever had.
Are you thinking about Monica?
Yeah.
What's that like?
Where we going?
This witness won't return my calls.
We'll surprise him coming home.
Surprise him?
We're not gonna make anybody mad, are we?
Come on, man.
You gonna squeeze the perp's shoes a bit before he lawyers up?
He's a witness, not a perp.
And no one talks like that.
Yeah.
No one talks like that.
Oh, what, like you're Mr. Cop?
I'm more cop than you two.
How do you figure that?
I'm in the front seat, okay?
I'm Gary's partner.
When you say "partner," it doesn't sound cop.
It sounds gay.
Jealous.
Hey, we're undercover here.
Oh, yeah.
No problem.
Ross!
Sorry.
There.
Hey, Gary.
Who am I?
Phone home.
Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
What's up with that, Serpico?
"What's up with that, Serpico?"
Are you thinking about me?
Okay, but we're safe, right?
Nothing bad's gonna go down.
No.
But that reminds me.
Sign this.
What is it?
It just says you can't sue if you scrape your knee... ...or get your head blown off.
Oh, hurry up.
I want to sign that.
Here he comes.
What is he doing?
What the hell is he doing?
What is it?
Is everything okay?
What?
He sees us.
Don't move.
And don't look at him!
Hey, it's okay.
It was just a car backfire.
Hey, look at that.
You tried to save your buddy.
You see that?
You see what he did?
You okay, man?
You all know I'm a pacifist, so I'm not interested in war in any way.
Is Monica here?
She's steaming her dress.
Why?
I think Chandler's gone.
What?
He left that.
"Tell Monica I'm sorry."
Oh, my God.
What's up?
"Tell Monica I'm sorry."
Tell her yourself.
Oh, my God.
Chandler just left, though?
Maybe it's not what we think.
Maybe it's: "Tell Monica I'm sorry I drank the last of the milk."
Or maybe he was writing to tell her that he's changed his name: "Tell Monica I'm Sorry."
It means he freaked out and left!
Phoebe, I think Ross is right.
What are we gonna do?
I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back.
You make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
But if you don't find him and bring him back...
...I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
Ross said still no word from Chandler.
Oh, man.
But they found the grandmother wandering down 5th Avenue.
Okay, well, there's one down.
My day is finally here!
She might not even notice he's gone.
I'm gonna start getting ready!
We can't let her start getting ready.
This is too awful!
But she'll be in the gown and then he won't show up... ...then she'll have to take off the gown... Stop it.
You can't do this here.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's just so sad.
Pull it together.
She can't see you like this.
She'll know something's wrong.
I know.
I know.
Oh, God!
There's no tissue.
Can you grab me some toilet paper?
Oh, that's gone too.
This is Monica's bathroom, right?
I found one.
Okay.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Oh, God.
Can I have another one?
Sure.
Do you need some floss?
I can't imagine what will happen if he doesn't show up.
Here's a whole bunch.
She'll be at the wedding waiting... ...and people will be whispering, "Oh, that poor girl."
Then she'll have to come back here and live alone.
Oh, my God.
What?
There was a pregnancy test in the garbage.
And it's positive.
Monica's pregnant.
So I guess she won't be totally alone.
Oh, my God!
Look at you!
You look great!
Do I?
Thank you.
So do you.
Sparkly!
This is pretty wonderful, Mr. Major Capades Guy!
I remember when you were just King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice Is Nice.
You always said I'd make it.
Well, you know, I'm kind of spooky that way.
Gosh, I missed you!
I'm gonna get changed.
Okay.
Now.
Oh!
Right.
Okay.
Ole!
What?
The Matador... Ole!
Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.
There I am.
There I am.
There I am...
So what's up?
You came to see me yesterday.
I kind of need a divorce.
O... ...kay.
How come?
Actually, I'm getting married again.
What?
I don't know how to tell you this.
I'm straight.
I don't understand.
How can you be straight?
You're so smart and funny... ...and you throw such great Academy Award parties!
That's what I kept telling myself.
But you reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.
How long have you known?
I guess on some level I always knew I was straight.
I thought I was supposed to be something else.
I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay.
I was just trying to fit in.
And there's actually a woman?
Her name's Debra.
Well, is she the first that you've been with?
I've never told you this... ...but there were one or two times back in college when...
...I'd get drunk, go to a straight bar... ...and wake up with a woman next to me.
I told myself it was the liquor, and everyone experiments in college.
Sure.
Now I know I don't have a choice.
I was born this way!
I don't know what to say.
You're married to someone for six years and you think you know him.
And then one day he says, "Oh, I'm not gay!"
I'm still me.
Why couldn't you just have figured this out six years ago?
You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
In a nutshell So, have you told your parents?
No, but it'll be okay.
They're pretty cool.
My brother's straight, so...
Here you go.
You know what?
I just have one more question.
If you had figured this out sooner, and I had been around... ...do you think I would have been the one...?
No.
Don't tell me.
I don't think either answer would make me feel better.
Here.
I love you, Phoebe.
So your brother's straight, huh?
Seriously.
And my secondgrade teacher was Miss Thomas... ...and my firstgrade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
I can't do this.
I did it.
It was me.
I'm sorry.
I kissed your mom.
What?
I was upset about Rachel and Paolo and I had too much tequila, and Nora Mrs.
Mom, your Bing, was just being nice.
But nothing happened.
Nothing.
Ask Joey.
Joey came in.
You knew about this?
You know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
I spent the entire day with you.
Why didn't you tell me?
You're lucky I caught them, or else who knows what would've happened?
Thanks, man.
Big help.
I can't believe this!
What were you thinking?
I wasn't.
I don't know.
I.
No one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
I know.
I can't believe you did this!
Me neither.
I'm mad at you for not telling me.
What are you mad at me?
Let me slam the door!
I didn't kiss her.
He did.
See what happens when you break the code?
Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody.
What the hell was that?
Phoebe just started.
I was talking to Joey.
All right, there, motherkisser?
"Motherkisser. "
I'll shut up.
Chandler, I know you're still mad at me but there were two people there that night.
There were two sets of lips.
I expect this from her.
She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
If she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
Because it's complicated.
It's complex!
Hey, you kissed my mom!
We're rehearsing a Greek play.
That's funny.
Are we done now?
You mean you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
No.
Just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her.
Trust me, you can't talk to her.
Okay.
"You can't"?
Or you can't?
Okay, that's my finger.
Okay, that's my knee.
Still doing the play.
Anything you want from Lisbon?
Just knowing you're there is enough.
All right.
Well, be good.
I love you.
You kissed my best Ross!
Or something to that effect.
Look, it was stupid.
Really stupid.
Really stupid.
And I don't even know how it happened.
I'm sorry, honey.
I promise it will never happen again.
Are we okay now?
No.
The forbidden love of a man and his door.
He told her off.
And not just about the kiss, about everything!
You're kidding?
He said, "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realize I have a bomb?"
Are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna grow up and realize I am your mom?"
That makes more sense.
You think?
What's going on now?
I don't know.
I've been standing here spelling it out for you.
I don't hear anything.
Wait!
What do you see?
It's hard to tell.
They're tiny and upside down.
Wait, wait, wait!
They're walking away.
They're walking away.
No, they're not.
They're coming right at us.
Run, run!
Are you okay, kiddo?
Yeah, I'm okay.
All right.
You be good.
Drive safe.
Mrs. Bing.
Mr. Geller.
You mean that?
Yeah, why not?
So I told her.
How did it go?
Awful.
Awful.
Couldn't have gone worse.
Well, how do you feel?
Pretty good.
I told her.
Well, see?
So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea me kissing your mom, huh?
But we don't have to go down that road.
You can usually find them on the heaving beasts.
Well, lesson learned.
Rachel is mean.
Yep, yep, yep.
I remember when she took me out on her dad's boat.
She wouldn't let me help at all.
Excuse me, I wanted you to help.
But you couldn't move... ...because you were wearing three life jackets.
You have to respect the sea.
Joey, I'm sorry if you thought that was mean.
But I tell you, that was not mean.
My father is mean.
He used to always yell at me on the boat.
It was horrible.
I was being a really good teacher.
Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer, pinhead!"
Does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
Six and a half.
You knocked the last one out of my hand, remember?
I didn't want you to get hit by the boom.
Well, it hit me anyway.
It would have hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
I'm sorry.
I will try to tone it down and stop yelling.
No bossing me around?
I won't boss you around.
And be nice?
I'll be nice.
You'll be topless?
Joey!
You want me to learn?
Okay, Joey.
You're doing really good.
I just need you to step to the portside.
Remember talking about the portside?
Oh, yeah.
No.
It's left, sweetie, but that's okay.
That's a tough one.
Why not just say left?
Okay, go to the left.
The left.
Just sit over there!
You're yelling again.
See that?
Oh, no, no.
Very quiet.
Said with love, no yelling.
You know what?
Since I'm here, I'm gonna have a beer on the portside.
See what I did there?
We're luffing a little.
Can you tighten up the Cunningham?
You just said a bunch of stuff I don't know.
Joey, come on!
We just went over this.
We did that when that bird... ...flew over with the fish in his mouth.
Did you see it?
It was gross.
I did not see the bird or the fish!
I did not see the piece of Styrofoam shaped like Mike Tyson!
I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat.
Which obviously is an impossible thing to do.
You're yelling, and I don't see you taking your top off.
I quit!
What do you mean?
You can't quit.
Why not?
You're not finished!
I won't have it.
Greens do not quit.
Greens?
I'm a Tribbiani.
Tribbianis quit.
Oh, my God.
I just said, "Greens don't quit," didn't I?
Did I say, "Greens don't quit"?
Yes!
And you're still yelling at me.
No, I'm not yelling at you.
I'm just yelling near you.
Oh, God, Joey.
I'm my father.
Oh, my God.
This is horrible.
I try so hard not to be my mother, I didn't see this coming.
I'm so sorry.
I just wanted you to learn.
I did learn.
Really?
Yeah, come on.
It's okay.
I know what a mainsail is.
I know to duck when the boom comes across.
I know port is right.
Left.
Damn it!
Well, Joey, I hate to admit it... ...your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
Why don't you give a pull on that rope?
We're not sailing.
Just pull on it.
All right.
Sandwiches!
What else?
Here you go.
Thank you.
Oh, wow.
What are you doing?
Sorry.
Not like that.
You're letting all the good stuff fall out.
Careful!
You're wasting good pastrami!
Oh, my God.
I'm my dad
Hey, Mr. Treeger.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
It's a little old but... You're clogging up the chute I just unclogged.
I'm sorry.
I don't come in here a lot.
Of course not.
You're a little princess.
Daddy, buy me a pizza.
Daddy, buy me a candy factory.
Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing "Happy Birthday" to me.
You think you can come here... ...make a mess and a big man in coveralls will clean it up?
Think of someone else for a change.
Okay, I'm sorry.
God, if you're going to cry about it!
The One With Ballroom Dancing Treeger made you cry?
There's this superintendents' dance, "The Super Ball."
He wants to impress Marge, this lady super he likes.
Why not practice with a girl?
He's too shy.
He's not good enough to dance with girls yet.
Yeah, right.
He almost danced me right down that garbage chute.
Would you let it go already?
You're fine.
So did you quit?
I'm not that comfortable dancing with a So how goes the dancing?
Gay yet?
You guys owe me bigtime.
What was that?
You just did a little dancy thing.
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did.
You did a little hop.
You are so enjoying this.
No, I'm not.
And it wasn't a hop.
It was a pas de bourree.
You know the words!
You are so into this!
Maybe I'm enjoying it a little.
I'm getting pretty good at it.
This is so sweet.
Joey, our little twinkletoes.
This isn't some kind of girly dance.
It's like a sport, it's manly.
Show me some "manly" moves.
All right.
I don't know how to lead.
It's really been a bad day, whorewise.
Hey, Duck.
Is Chick here?
Yeah, Bunny Rabbit.
Ready for our last practice?
We're not getting that spin right because my place is too small.
Want to use our place?
No, I had another idea.
We did it!
That was incredible!
That was amazing!
We totally nailed it!
Hey, listen.
Thanks a lot, Tribbiani.
Oh, my God!
Look at the time.
I got to catch the bus to the ball.
Good luck.
Unless you want to practice the fox trot.
Or the tango?
Thanks, but no.
You see, I think I'm ready to dance with girls.
Go get them, Treeger.
Right.
You want to come?
Marge has a friend.
Really?
You'd dance good with her.
She's the same size as me.
No, I'm good.
It looks like you've got great experience.
The one with "Heston" on it.
Interesting.
I got some ones.
You want to put them in her panties?
No, thanks, Mom!
That.
You have to put that out because I'm pregnant.
Maybe you and your baby ought to go to another strip club.
It's not my baby.
Very good.
Really good.
I enjoyed it.
Very exotic.
I just checked our messages and Joshua didn't call.
You'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up.
You know what makes it worse?
Ross is all happy in Vermont.
Come on, look where you are!
Another round of daiquiris.
Virgin for me.
Don't let me leave without the name of that carpet guy.
Come on!
You know what?
I'll go home and call Kathy.
If it'll help.
That was a test.
In a few hours, I'll be drunk.
I'll want to call her.
You'll have to stop me.
Then I'll be so drunk, I'll want to call Janice.
You should!
How is she?
I think somebody needs another lap dance.
Who's in there?
We did okay at the strip club, right?
Great.
Thanks to you, the hottest waitress is quitting... ...to teach the third grade!
He still hasn't called.
Who, Josh?
It's Joshua.
He doesn't like "Josh"?
No, I don't.
I'm going to put my sweats back on.
You know what?
You were right.
We weren't great at being guys.
You know why?
Because we're girls.
You know what girls are good at?
Stripping!
No, listening!
Sit.
Maybe it would really, really help if you would just talk.
Yeah, come on.
What's going on in there?
And you know, if you want to cry, that's okay too.
I'm going to have to ask you all to leave.
Forget it.
We tried, but phase three is a lost cause.
Those strippers were hot, and I couldn't picture myself with them.
They really were pretty, weren't they?
I liked that fighter pilot one.
Candy?
She was so spunky!
I think if I were going to be with a woman... ...it'd be with someone like Michelle.
She was just so petite.
For me, it would have to be Chantal.
She had the smoothest skin.
I stuck that dollar in her Gstring and grazed her thigh Phase three!
I just achieved phase three!
I am totally picturing you with all those women!
That's not phase three.
Well, I'm there too!
Are we all together in a group?
Stop it, you're killing me!
I think I moved on to phase four!
What is that?
I don't want a relationship ever!
I just want sex with strippers and my friends!
Come on.
Let me see that smile.
I don't want to.
Please?
I wanted to go to the strip club!
You'll have plenty of chances.
There are thousands of women out there, just waiting to screw me over.
Yeah, all right.
How was Vermont?
Oh, no, happy for you.
All right.
Here's what we'll do.
You are going to take off my clothes.
You two, go get the oils.
And you, just constantly scream... ..."Chandler's the king!
Chandler's the king!"
I want to be with her.
I like her.
That's fine.
Go with your instincts!
What am I doing again?
Pay attention.
I could wake up at any moment.
I'm Joshua.
I'm here to pick up Rachel.
That's not Joshua.
What do you want from me?
I never met the guy.
I'm sorry you can't stay.
The rest of us have a lot of work to do.
What are you doing?
All right, listen.
I got to wake up

You said it was going to be fun.
Which it kind of is.
You said there would be guys.
There are no guys.
There's one right over there.
That's a mailman!
That's our mailman!
Hi, how are you... Don't worry.
This doesn't make you any less of a guy.
That does.
What am I sitting on?
What was this woman scratching when this broke off?
You know who had nails like that?
Done?
Yep!
What's up?
This switch is driving me crazy.
I turned it off and checked every outlet.
Four don't work, which means one is controlled by the switch.
So I plugged things in the outlets that make noise.
That way, when I turn it on, I just follow the noise.
Bet I stopped listening first.
You know, you also could have used lamps... ...and followed the light.
Yeah, well, I'm using noise.
So, everybody ready?
Here we go!
Something.
I hear something.
Where is it?
It's coming from Joey!
Oh, my God!
That's so freaky!
It might be raining.
Hold on.
I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN.
I'm man enough to play this sport!
You're not even man enough to get the channel that carries the sport.
Hey there, Ross!
Janice.
You know, you really didn't have to help me pack.
When you said all you'd be doing before you leave is packing... ...you really didn't leave me much choice.
I thought I did, but I guess I did not.
What's going on?
I'm packing, you know, because I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
Thanks for telling me!
I'm going to be pretendmoving to Yemen.
To get rid of her.
Good one!
Yemen!
That actually sounds like a real country!
I'll show you how to roll your underwear and stuff it in your shoes.
It's a spacesaver.
I do that because it makes me look taller.
Come on!
Joey, trade lives with me.
Nope.
Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play.
This is brutal!
I can handle it.
Please, Ross.
You got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
That's because your mom's dog kept looking at me.
Look!
Right here, it's called a "scrum."
It's like a huddle.
And is a hum like a scruddle?
Ross, they're going kill you!
Why are you doing this, anyway?
You should've seen the guy she used to date.
He's like "Joe Rugby"!
You're kidding!
And he plays rugby?
That's funny!
Oh, I see.
You did that.
She thought the very idea of me playing rugby was hilarious.
So I'll show her how tough I really am.
I'm sorry.
You are a tough guy.
The toughest paleontologist I know.
Ross can take care of himself.
It's not like he's Chandler.
Thanks.
Don't worry about me.
I'll just look energetic and stay away from the ball.
Oh, my God!
Look at this!
But there is a wire there!
This is the final boarding call for flight 664 to Yemen.

Who of the six of you... ...has slept with who of the six of you?
Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.
I'm sorry, the answer there would be none of us.
Come on.
Over the years, none of you ever got, you know, drunk and stupid?
Well, that's really a different question.
I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends... ...as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
What?
What?
Excuse me, there was no time.
Okay, but let's say there was.
How might that go?
Okay.
Okay.
Well, then answer me this: Have any of you ever almost...?
I would like to propose a toast... ...to the woman who, in one year from today, will become... ...Mrs. Dr. Barry Barber, D.D.S.
I think it's time to see the ring again.
Isn't it exciting?
I mean, it's like having a boyfriend for life.
Yeah.
I know.
What?
Oh, I don't know.
Well, maybe it's just the idea... ...of Barry for the rest of my life.
I don't know, I think I...
I feel like I need to have one last fling... ...you know, just to sort of get it out of my system.
Rachel, stop!
You're so bad!
I'm serious.
I really think I need to just have... ...some meaningless sex, you know?
With the next guy I see.
Excuse me, I seem to have dropped my ball.
Yeah, so?
And now I've picked it up again.
My God!
I went to high school with her.
Rachel!
Hi!
What do you think?
Oh, my God!
You can't even see where the Titanic hit it.
Yes, his name is Barry.
He's a doctor, thank you very much.
Just like you always wanted.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
So how about you?
Are you seeing anybody?
Not right now.
Oh, well, that's okay.
I know.
So I think I'll get back to my friend.
Oh, yeah.
Sure, sure, sure.
Listen, can we please have lunch the next time I'm in the city?
That'd be great.
Okay.
Thanks.
Bye.
Bye.
Ten bucks says I never see that woman again in my life.
No, honey, really.
It's fine.
Just... Go with Susan.
Really, I think...
I think girls' night out is a great idea.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye.
So, what are they doing?
I don't know.
Something girly.
Hey, you're early.
What are you doing with the lamp?
I'm just taking it to get rewired.
Don't take it to the place you took the stereo.
They've had that for over a week.
No!
Mr. Heckles, no one is making any noise up here.
You're disturbing my oboe practice.
You don't play the oboe.
I could play the oboe.
Then I'm gonna have to ask you to keep it down.
Who are you?
I'm Eric, I'm gonna be Chandler's new roommate.
I'm Chandler's new roommate.
I don't think so.
I could be Chandler's new roommate.
But he told me over the phone...
He told me in person.
That's weird.
Well, I'm going to go into my new apartment now.
Your little creature's got the remote again.
Marcel, give Rossy the remote.
Marcel!
Marcel, you give Rossy the remote right now!
You give Rossy the remote.
Great.
Relax.
I'll fix it.
Oh, cool.
Urkel in Spanish is Urkel.
How did he do this?
Is leaving the Christmas lights up your plan to keep us merry all year long?
Someone was supposed to take them down around New Year's but obviously someone forgot!
Someone was supposed to write: "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the refrigera.
How long has that been there?
Where you been?
Riff's.
I think Ursula likes me.
All I ordered was coffee.
She brought me a tuna melt and four plates of curly fries.
Score.
She is so hot!
Okay, before you do anything Joeylike you might want to run it by.
Pheebs?
Would it be okay if I asked out your sister?
Why?
Why would you want to do that?
Why?
So that if we went out on a date, she'd be there.
Well, I mean, I'm not my sister's, you know whatever.
And I mean, it's true, we were one egg once.
But, you know, we've grown apart, so.
I don't know.
Why not?
Cool.
Thanks.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Do you wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
Sorry.
Sorry I'm late.
I can't believe you.
You still haven't told that girl she doesn't have a job?
You still haven't taken down the Christmas lights.
Congratulations!
I think you found the world's thinnest argument.
Trying to find the right moment.
That shouldn't be so hard, now that you're dating.
"Sweetheart, you're fired.
But how about a quickie before I go to work?"
Once you're inside, you don't have to knock anymore.
I'll get it.
Hi, Mr. Heckles.
You're doing it again.
We're not doing anything.
We're just sitting around talking quietly.
I can hear you through the ceiling.
My cats can't sleep.
You don't even have cats.
I could have cats.
Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.
We'll try to keep it down.
Phoebe, can you do me a favor?
Try this on to make sure it fits.
My first birthday present!
Oh, this is really.
It's for Ursula.
I just figured, you know, sizewise.
Sure.
Yeah.
Okay, it fits.
Are you seeing her again?
Yep, Ice Capades.
This is serious.
I've never known you to pay money for any kind of "capade. "
I don't know.
I like her.
She's different.
There's something about her.
That you like.
We get it.
You like her.
Phoebe, I asked you and you said it was okay.
Well, maybe now it's not okay.
Well, maybe now I'm not okay with it not being okay.
Knit, good woman.
Knit!
Knit!
Oh, hey handsome!
Oh, I'm gonna love you so much   that no woman is   ever gonna be good enough for you!
Oh, we are so lucky!
I know.
He has your eyes.
I mean,  I know that's not possible,   but he does.
We'll just get him  cleaned up a bit.
/Okay.
Oh my God, he's beautiful.
Thank you so much.
I'm really happy for you guys.
How do you feel?
I'm tired!
Well, you don't have that much time to relax.
The other one will be along  in a minute.
I...
I'm sorry, who should be along  in a what now?
The next baby   should be along in a minute.
We only ordered one!
You know it's twins, right?
Oh, yeah!
These are the faces  of two people in the know!
I can't believe  you didn't know it's twins!
This has never happened before.
Well, gosh.
That makes me feel so special  and good.
Wait, did you know it was twins?
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork   we got from the clinic in Ohio.
Anybody tell you?
I don't think so.
Although, they did mention  something about two heartbeats.
But I thought that was  just mine and the baby's.
They kept saying  both heartbeats are really strong,  and I thought well, that's good  'cause I'm having a baby.
This is unbelievable.
Twins actually run in my family.
Interesting!
Can I see you for a second?
What do we do?
What do you mean "what do we do"?
Twins!
Twins!!
Chandler, you're panicking!
Uhhuh!
Join me, won't you?!
Okay, what do you say we  keep one, and then just like  have an option on the other one?
We can't split them up!
Why not?
We could give each of them  half a medallion,   and then years later,  they'll find each other    and be reunited.
I mean,  that's a great day for everybody.
Okay, what if the person   who adopts the other one  is horrible?
What if they're not?
What if it's adopted by a king?
Yeah, because I hear   the king is looking to adopt.
Monica, we are not ready   to have two babies!
That doesn't matter!
We have waited so long for this.
I don't care if it's two babies.
I don't care if it's three babies!
I don't care  if the entire cast of  "Eight is Enough"  comes out of there!
We are taking them home,  because they are our children!
Okay.
Shhh...
Okay.
/  Okay!
Okay!
It looks like   we're about ready over here.
Come on, Erica,  start pushing again now.
/Ow!
Here she comes!
She?
It's a girl?
Yeah.
Well, now we have one of each!
And that's enough!
We're going to take Erica to recovery now.
Come on, just tell me.
Please, please!
For the 16th time: No, I do not think you're obsessive!
It's hot in here!
Rach, get the heat.
Ross, turn the heat down, please?
The difference between obsessive Ross, the heat!
Okay!
Heat, heat, heat!
And I'm the obsessive one?
I'm going in.
All right!
Good luck, Pheebs.
Here I go.
I'm going.
Welcome to our tropical Christmas party.
It's hard to tell because I'm sweating... ...but I use exactly what the gel bottle says.
An amount about the size of a pea.
How can that be too much?
Ice?
Ice?
Ice squares anyone?
Take a napkin.
Monica!
Your guests are turning into jerky.
Really?
I'm perfectly comfortable.
Anything!
No, I will not cave.
I'm with Mon.
All right.
Do you think there's a chance you can fix that radiator now?
No can do.
Like I told the girl...
...I can't get a knob until Tuesday.
Ross?
He's playing baseball.
You mean hardball?
Whatever.
What you gonna do?
Excuse me.
I'm seizing.
Mr. Treeger?
Here's another 50.
Happy Hanukkah.
Will this help with the knobgetting?
No, the place is not open till Tuesday.
Am I not saying it right?
So you really did like my cookies?
Yeah, they were so personal.
It really showed you cared.
Nice seizing... ...gel boy.
Is this mistletoe?
No, that... That is basil.
If it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss you.
No, it's still basil.
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire Jack Frost nipping at your nose How far did you get?
Hey, it's after midnight!
Merry Christmas, everyone!
Oh, right!
Merry Christmas!
The knob was broken... ...so I turned it off from underneath.
I hope that's all right.
Rach, these are for you.
Wiper blades!
I don't even have a car.
No, but with this newcar smell, you'll think you do!
Okay, Pheebs, your turn.
Toiletseat covers!
And for Ross... ...Mr. Sweet Tooth.
You got me a cola drink?
And a lemonlime!
Well, this is too much!
I feel like I should get you another sweater.
And last, but not least...
They're ribbed for your pleasure
I can't believe you talked me into this gumballmachinelooking ring.
It's not a gumballmachinelooking ring.
It's a beautiful ring!
No, it's not.
When I looked at the other ring, I could see Monica's face... and I could see her saying yes.
Looking at this, I only see a ring.
Unless I look at it really closely, and then I can see my own eye.
This is the most important thing I'll ever do.
I want to make it perfect.
Maybe we could get the other ring back.
I heard where the guy was gonna propose.
Maybe we could get him to trade rings.
I can't do that.
You certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.
There he is.
He hasn't proposed yet.
She has no ring on.
Wow, you're good!
After this, we should solve crimes.
Okay.
Go get him.
Oh, okay.
Excuse me.
Could you come with me?
You have a phone call.
Who is it?
It's your office.
Do you know who at my office?
John.
Oh, John!
Great!
There he is.
Hi.
Okay.
There was a mixup at the store.
The ring you have was supposed to be held for me.
I'm gonna need to have that back.
In exchange, I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring.
Wow, I would trade.
It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use this one.
Excuse me.
This is my fiancee, and her heart was set on that ring.
Do you want to break her heart?
Yeah.
Do you want to break a dying woman's heart?
You're dying?
Yeah, she's dying... of a cough, apparently.
It's my dying wish to have that ring.
If I'm not buried with it... my spirit will wander the netherworld.. That's enough!
Oh, I don't know.
Let me see it.
Great.
Okay, here.
All right, I'll do it.
Thank you.
And you are about to marry a wonderful man.
Hey, I'm marrying a dead woman!
Guys?
I've got something important to tell you.
Guys?
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
I think we gotta end the freezeout.
Wait.
Is this for real?
Yeah.
Check out the ring.
Oh, my God!
So you two are really serious?
Yeah, pretty much.
You're gonna get married?
We're gonna be brothersinlaw!
Come here!
And we're gonna be friends again.
What?
Water under the bridge!
Forget it!
Okay.
I was gonna wait till it was official, but I had to tell you guys.
You're my best friends.
Oh!
No more crying!
I just dumped one crybaby.
I'll dump you too.
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Oh, my God!
Oh, Chandler!
You guys are gonna be so happy!
I know.
Where's all the tissues?!
Check out the ring.
Oh, nice.
One and a half carat, easy.
Hey.
Hey, Phoebe.
He's gonna ask Monica to marry him.
I helped pick out the ring.
You told her before you told us?
She walked in while I was looking at brochures.
You can understand that.
Guys?
God, that ring Chandler picked out was so beautiful.
Of all of your wives, I'm the only one who never got a ring.
Come on in.
Are you sure?
It's fine, it's fine.
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.
So how are you doing?
I'm.
I'm okay.
You look great.
Dr. Farber, Jason Greenspan 's gagging.
Be right there.
I'll be back in a second.
I dumped him.
I believe Julia's on the table.
Sorry about that.
So what have you been up to?
Not much.
I got a job.
That's great!
Why are you so tan?
I went to Aruba.
Oh, no!
You went on our honeymoon alone?
No.
See, I went with.
Now, this may hurt.
Me?
I went with Mindy.
Mindy?
My maid of honor?
We're kind of a thing now.
You got plugs!
Careful, careful.
They haven't quite taken yet.
And you got lenses.
But you hate sticking your finger in your eye.
Not for her.
Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
A month ago, I wanted to hurt you more than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone.
And I'm an orthodontist.
You know, you were right.
I thought we were happy.
We weren't.
But with Mindy, now I'm happy.
Spit.
What?
Me.
Anyway I guess this belongs to you.
And thank you for giving it to me.
Well, thank you for giving it back.
Hello!
Oh, please!
I think it's the Dying Cat Parade.
Sounds like it's coming from across the street.
Oh, my God.
What?
The thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?
He was hanging out with me and said, "You're half Scottish, right?"
No.
Yes!
No.
There is no way.
It cannot be Ross.
Unbelievable.
Why is your family Scottish?
Why is your family Ross?
He cannot play at our wedding.
Everyone will leave.
I mean, come on.
That is just noise!
It's not even a song.
Wait.
If you listen very carefully...
...I think it's "Celebration" by Kool and the Gang.
Hi.
How are you?
Well, I feel like a snack.
Do you want some shortbread?
It's Scottish, like you are.
Oh, no, thanks.
I don't like anything from my Scottish heritage.
What?
Well, it's just that my entire family was run out of Scotland by... ...Vikings.
Anyway, lots of bad memories.
It sounds to me like your family's ready to rediscover its Scottish roots.
No.
No, they're not.
Yeah, but the Scottish history is so much... You can't play bagpipes at the wedding!
How did you know about that?
We heard you play from your apartment.
Were you the ones who called the cops?
That's not really important right now.
What is important is, while we appreciate the gesture... ...we just don't feel that bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
Why not?
Because we hate them.
Come on, that's not fair.
Just give me a chance to perform for you, then decide whatever you want.
I'm not gonna tell you what song I'm gonna play either.
Let's just say when it's over...
...I'll bet there'll be a wee bit of celebration.
The essence of the character is rooted in her confidence.
You too
That woman at the game didn't know  what she was talking about  Mike, obviously you have balls  Please let's just forget the whole thing.
I would love it  Consider it forgotten / Thank you  But just so you know  however and whenever you decide to propose,  I promise I'll say yes  Whether, whether, you know,  it's at a basketball game or in skywriting  or you know like some lame guy in a cheesy movie,  " Hide it in the cake"   It's in the cake, isn't it?
Where else would lame Mr. Noballs hide it?
What's the matter with me?
Why do I keep ruining this?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, it's my fault  I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and  all I want to do is tell you that I love you  and I, I want to spend the rest of my life with you and   I'm going to do this now  Oh my God!
Phoebe, I... / Wait , wait.
Oh, no.
Great?
/ Uhhuh   Phoebe, I love you  There's no one else in the world I would ask to marry me  Three times  But I want to take care of you,  have babies with you  and grow old with you   Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
Yes   I love you  I love you more  Not possible   She's going to be Mrs. Noballs   So how's the baby styling business going?
It was cool seeing you lecture today.
Thanks.
Although it kind of seemed likeyou were falling asleep.
No, I had my eyes closed so I couldconcentrate and, you know, take it all in.
Yeah, a lot of my students do that.
I've got to get going.Okay, I'll see you tonight?
Thanks for showing me yoursemipreciousstone collection.
It's amazing.
My God, you must be good in bed.
So you and Mona, it's been a while now.How's it going?
It's good.
It's going good.
I mean, we get along great.She's so..
Hot?I was gonna say sweet, but yeah!
She's okay with the baby?
I haven't actually told her yet.I don't wanna scare her off.
You have to be honest.
Otherwise, you maythink you're going down the same path..   but you're really goingdown different ones.
I'm gonna take that bookand I'm gonna beat you to death with it.
I love your place.Where is this guy from?
That's an 18thcentury lndian artifactfrom Calcutta.
Oh.
Wow.
So you're more than just dinosaurs.
So much more.
Oh, my God!
I am so sorry!
Forget it.
It's from Pier 1.
Sorry.
You think you can knock up my daughterand then not marry her?
I'm gonna kill you!
You know, this is actually nota great time for me.
So come on.Explain yourself, Geller.
First, you get my Rachel pregnant.You got Rachel pregnant?
Who did?You did!
Yes, I did, but it was a onenight thing.It meant nothing.
Oh?
Really?
That's what my daughtermeans to you, nothing?
No, sir.
She means a lot to me.I care..
I love Rachel.
What?But not that way.
I'm not in love with her.I love her like a friend.
That's how you treat a friend,get her in trouble and refuse to marry her?
Hey, I offered to marry her.But I didn't want to.
Well, why not?
So you couldspend your time with this tramp?
Tramp?
I'm sorry.
Dr. Green, Mona.Mona, Dr. Green.
I can't believe there isa naked hooker in there!
How could you have kept all this from me?I was going to tell you, but..   You figure you'd get what you wanted,then you'd dump her like you did Rachel.
Hey, I did not dump Rachel.Nor are we still together.
Can I..?
Why don't we just let the machine get that.
Hey, Ross, it's Joey.There's a hooker over here..   and we thought maybe you'dknow something about it.
No!
No!
No!
No!
I need to lie down.
Packed while you were gone.
I left knickers under your pillow.
Move in with me?
What?
Don't be scared.
It sounds crazy, and people will say it's too soon... ...but just think.
Think how great it would be.
I don't know.
Leaving London... My whole family lives there... My job.
You'll get a job here.
I always hear about them foreigners stealing American jobs.
That could be you.
Yeah, but it's my whole life.
You come to England.
I would.
I really would.
But my son is here.
I can't leave him.
You don't think there's any way?
I don't think so.
It would be different if it was way into the future... ...and we were getting married.
What?
Right.
I shouldn't have said "married."
Please don't go freaky on me.
I didn't mean it.
I take it back.
No.
Don't.
Why don't we?
Why don't we what?
Get married.
You are mad!
No, I'm not!
It's perfect.
It's better than you moving here.
It's us together forever, and that's what I want.
We've known each other six weeks!
I know.
So what?
Who's to say?
Does that mean we can't do it?
Look.
I was with Carol for four years before we got married... ...and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian.
I mean, this...
This makes sense for us.
Our first date, we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont.
I mean, last night I got my ear pierced.
Me!
This feels right.
Doesn't it?
My parents will be really mad.
Are you saying, "Yes"?
Is that "Yes"?
Yes.
We're getting married!
Oh, my God!
We're getting married!
Come here, come here.
Emily, will you marry me?
It's a bit small.
Damn!
I thought that'd be romantic as hell.
Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
Emily and I, we decided... ...to get married.
What?
Oh, are you pregnant too?
No.
When did How did you We just decided to go for it.
We know it's a bit hasty... ...but it just feels so right.
I was just telling the guys Yeah, I heard.
I think it's great!
I'm so happy for you!
Well, yeah!
Congratulations!
I can't believe you're getting married!
Monica and Rachel made out.
All right, I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna go get shot down.
Any advice?
Just be yourself... ...but not too much.
Wish me luck.
Good luck!
Wish it!
I was just sitting over there and... My name's Chandler.
Did I say that?
No, you didn't.
Hi, I'm Kathy.
Kathy with a K or a C?
With a K. Wow, you are really good at this!
I'm out on a limb here!
I'm sorry.
You're right.
But I should tell you, I'm waiting for a date.
And there he is now!
I see you guys already met.
I was trying to demonstrate... ...how I could get my very large feet... ...into my even bigger mouth.
Didn't I tell you?
Always showing off.
Before I start, I want to say that I have a cold.
So if I sneeze during a song, it's not on purpose.
Except the last verse of "Pepper People."
Smelly cat, smelly cat What are they feeding you?
This chick sounds good.
Smelly cat Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
At 2:30 a.m., I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.
Sorry, there's this Ernie Kovacs thing I wanted to watch.
That's why I got up too.
You're kidding?
I love him!
I'm sorry about this afternoon.
If I had known that you two, I never would have... Oh, please.
Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
They teamed us up as partners.
Joey picked three scenes for us to do.
All of them had us making out.
That's a good thing because he used to make me rehearse with him.
Is it on?
No, but this Wonder Broom is amazing!
Oh, my God!
It's on!
Here we go, little fella.
What about the duck?
The duck can swim.
My sticky shoes My sticky, sticky shoes Why you stick on me?
Baby Thanks for the lights, honey.
Way to go!
Your cold makes you sound great.
It's fun.
God, I love how sexy I am!
Kath, we should get going.
We're going to buy hamsters.
I love them.
No, it's not like that.
I work for a medical researcher.
Well, have fun.
Okay.
It's nice that the medical community... ...is trying to help sick hamsters.
I like Kathy.
Me too!
She's so cool and pretty.
She is.
She's smart and funny.
We were up all last night talking.
She said the funniest thing about What?
You love her.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
Chandler loves Kathy.
Come on, just lay off him.
Thank you.
He's a little sensitive right now because he's so in love!
At least I made $10 in my relationship.

You know, I'm not that much of a sweet tooth... Oh, my God, it's so creamy!
That's the best cheesecake I've ever had!
Where did you get this?
It was at the front door when I got home.
Somebody sent it to us.
This isn't addressed to you.
This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs!
Thief!
I didn't read the box before I opened it... ...and you can't return a box after you opened it!
Why not?
Because it's too delicious!
You stole this cheesecake.
That's wrong.
No, it'll be okay because Mrs. Braverman will send for a free one.
That way, we all win.
The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate... ..."Mama's Little Bakery."
I feel terrible.
I'm a horrible, horrible person.
I'm sorry, what?
The One With All The Cheesecakes I should get going.
The other cheesecake came.
They delivered it here again.
Just bring it downstairs.
What's the problem?
I can't seem to say goodbye.
Are you serious?
We ate an entire cake two days ago and you want more?
Well, I've forgotten what it tastes like.
It was cheesecake.
It was fine.
It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust... ...with a very rich... ...yet light cream cheese filling.
Wow, my whole mouth just filled with saliva.
Well, thank you for lunch.
Wait, I thought you paid.
Apparently, we don't pay for food anymore.
Do you see what I see?
It's still there.
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
She could be out of town.
Maybe gone for months.
By then, it may spoil.
She can't come back to bad cheesecake.
It could kill her.
Don't want that.
We're protecting her.
Are you eating the cheesecake without me?
I will give you $ 100 to whistle right now.
How can you eat it without me?
What'll you do?
Tell Monica or Joey?
No, you'd have to tell them everything.
We're dessert stealers.
We're living outside the law.
I don't trust you with this cake.
I got it first, and I'm taking it back!
What?
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
You think I trust you with it?
No, we'll split it.
That's not fair.
You had some.
I think Monica would be very interested to know... ...that you called her cheesecake "dry and mealy."
What do we use to split it?
All right, pick a half.
Well, this side looks bigger.
But there's more crust on this side.
Maybe if I measure it...
Pick a piece!
All right, I pick that one.
It's the smaller piece.
Okay.
There you go.
Enjoy your half, my friend.
But that is it.
No sharing, no switching, and don't come crying to me... ...if you eat your piece too fast.
You gonna give me some of yours?
Oh, no.
No switching, no sharing.
And don't come crying to me.
I may just sit here and have my cake all day.
Just sit here in the hallway and eat my... Ross, sweetheart!
Oh, look!
There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it.
Stick to your side!
All right, wait here.
Hi, sweetie!
Are you leaving?
I'm telling you, up until I was 9 I thought gunpoint was a place where crimes happened.
How's that possible?
It's always on the news.
"A man is being held up at Gunpoint. "
"Tourists are terrorized at Gunpoint. "
And I kept thinking, why do people continue to go there?
I should go.
Unless.
What?
Unless you wanna stay over.
I mean, I'm going to.
So.
Yeah, I'd really Like that.
Before we get into any stayingover stuff there's something you should know.
Is this, Like, "I have an early class tomorrow" or "I'm secretly married to a goat"?
Well, it's somewhere in between.
You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not.
Well, I mean, I haven't ever.
Ethan?
Are you a virgin?
Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days, then yes, I am.
I am.
I've kind of been waiting for the right person.
Really?
You do know I was talking about you, right?
Wow!
You keep saying that.
You know, you read about it.
You see it in the movies.
Even when you practice it at home, man, oh, man it is nothing Like that.
Listen, listen.
You told me something that was really difficult for you.
And I figure if you can be honest, then I can too.
Don't tell me I did it wrong.
Nothing wrong about that.
Here goes.
I'm not 22.
I'm 25 and 1 3 months.
But I figure that shouldn't change anything.
What does it matter how old we are?
Listen as long as we're telling stuff I have another one for you.
I'm a little younger than I said.
You're not a senior?
Oh, I'm a senior in high school.
What we did was wrong.
I just had sex with someone who wasn't alive during the bicentennial!
I just had sex.
Ethan, focus.
How could you not tell me?
You never told me your age.
That's different!
My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states!
What were you thinking?
I was too busy falling.
Don't say it!
In Love with you.
Really?
Sorry.
Well, fall out of it.
You shouldn't be here.
It's a school night!
Oh, God!
I'm Like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad.
I'm Joan Collins.
Who?
Andre should be there in about 45 minutes.
You know what?
Would you like to come in?
Did Homo erectus hunt with wooden tools?
According to recent findings.
Here, Mitzi!
Here, Mitzi!
Mitzi is...?
My hamster.
I hope she's okay.
I haven't seen her in a while.
Have a seat.
Where?
Oh, hey.
Do you... Do you have any Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
Well, I do.
Let's go back to my place, light a couple candles... ...break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties...
I'd rather not.
Oh, yeah?
Why not?
Don't take this the wrong way... ...but your place kind of has a weird smell.
Is everything in the car?
So you just left?
Her place was really that bad?
You throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day.
Like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage.
And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage.
And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time... ...and garbage is all that has survived.
Here.
Wow.
Thanks.
So what happened?
Nothing.
I had to get out of there.
Next time, you take her to your place.
I tried that.
She says it has a weird smell.
What kind of smell?
I don't know.
Soap?
Listen, you like this girl, right?
Yeah.
You want to see her again?
Yeah.
So you're going to have to do it in the mess!
Yeah, okay.
You're right.
I mean, who cares about a little sloppiness?
It's endearing, really.
All right!
Now you go get that beautiful pig!
So you want to come inside?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
I'll be right back.
Make yourself comfortable.
Guess who?
Department of Sanitation?
It's me.
What?
Oh, Cheryl!
It's my hamster!
It's Mitzi!
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry.
I must have freaked out.
Thank God it's not Mitzi!
It's just a rat.
You don't know me.
I'm Monica Geller, Ross' sister.
You know, it's too bad that didn't work out.
Anyway, he told me about your apartment.
Well, I couldn't sleep thinking about it.
So would it be okay if I cleaned it?
I won't be able to sleep
Hey.Joey, honey, listen.
Thanks for talking to me yesterday.It meant a lot.
Not a problem.Just so you know..   that guy won't be botheringyou about that baby thing anymore.
What?Let's just say I took care of it.
Let's say more.
Don't worry.
I told him, very nicely:   "You don't go buying people's babies!So back off!"
What?What?
What?
Why?
So we would have somethingto talk about!
And you couldn't thinkof anything else?
You said your bosswants to buy your baby?
You yelled at my boss!I'll lose my job!
What am I gonna do?
You could always sell your baby.
I can't believe you broughtmy boss into it!
I'll be fired!
You lied to me!Well, she told me to!
Chandler has two copies of Annie!
Oh, my God!
Ross!Hello!
What are you doing?
Not touching myself, if that makesanyone less uncomfortable.
You wanted to see me?
Please, come in.
Have a seat.
Look, Mr.
Zelner..It's best I speak first.
Yeah.
Lee from Human Resources is hereas a witness to our conversation.
Oh, God.
If I in any way impliedthat I wanted to buy your baby..
I am sorry.
Okay?
Last week, when I asked youwhen your due date was..
I certainly did not mean thatI felt that I was "due" your baby.
I want to be very clear..   that I understandthat it's your baby..   and it is not mine to purchase.
Well, as long as we are clearabout that.
So?
What happened?It's all gonna be okay.
They're so happy I'm not suing, I gotan extra month paid maternity leave.
So long as I understand the moneyshould not be construed..   as a down payment on thisor any other child.
Ralph Lauren is goingout of their way..   to show they're notin the babybuying business.
Give us a minute?Kicking me out of my living room?
Yeah.
I'll be in there.
I'm sorry I lied to you.I was just trying to make things..
I know.
I know.
It kind of worked.
I don't know about you,but I haven't thought about our thing.
Yeah, you're right.
Yeah.
It's kind of beenlike "us" again, a little bit.
Yeah, I know.
I've missed that.Me too.
I haven't thought abouthow I put myself out there..   and said that stuff.How you didn't feel the same..   and how it was really awkward.
My gynecologist tried to kill me.
God, you're amazing.
I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.
Oh my God!
That's Charlie!
She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
Oh, that tart, floozy, Giant!
I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.
(Oh, I love Barbados)   Oh, I can't believe I'm kissing you.
I'm kissing Rachel!
I know!
I'm her!
Rachel and Joey!
It's Rachel and Joey!
What?
Get over here!
Whoa!
Oh my God!
Hey, you know, before, you said that nothing  could happen between us.
What changed?
Well, I only said that because of Ross  and then I saw him kissing Charlie.
What?
Ross and Charlie?
Wow!
She's really making her way  through the group, huh?
Eh, who am I to talk?
You, you got to hear this.
It's great!
It's, it's like free porn.
Is everything ok?
Yeah, it's just I...I don't think I can do this.
Oh, is it because of what might be under bed spread  cause I saw that news report too   with that infrared and we could just...  No, no, no, no, uh,   Look, I, I need to talk to Joey.
I mean you guys just broke up.
Before anything more happens between us,  I need to know he's okay with it.
I...I completely understand.
Alright, I'm gonna go find him.
I just need a, need a second  before I can...you know   Grandma, grandma,   Okay, I'll see you later.
Rach, you there?
Oh my God!
It's Ross.
What are we gonna do?
Ok, just , just, be calm, just be calm  for all I know is  we're just, we're just hanging out together.
Alright, let's just be nonchalant.
That's not nonchalant!
No idea what it means!
Oh!
Are they right?
Probably, yeah.
I mean, maybe we should ...  hold off until we talk to Ross.
Yeah, yeah.
We can wait.
We don't have to do anything tonight.
Yeah, I think, I think that would be best.
So, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna take off.
although...
I like although!
I mean, you know.
Ross and I haven't dated in like...  six years?
6 years?
Wow!
It's almost as long as high school.
Plus, you know he is ...with Charlie, you know.
Absolutely!
He's not thinking about you.
/ No!
I'm thinking about you.
Yeah.
Let's forget about Ross.
He's forgotten.
Waht's wrong?
Nothing.
Seriously, what is it?
Nothing.
It's really...it's nothing.
Come here.
Come here.
What's wrong?
Uh, sorry, I just...um,  I can't seem to get Ross out of my head.
Well, maybe I can help.
Ah, your lips are so soft.
Do that again?
Yeah, we, we need to tak to Ross.
Yeah.
Or this one!
How are you?
Got any morning sickness?The guys don't know yet, do they?
Joey and Ross don't know anything.Chandler thinks Phoebe's pregnant.
That's right.Chandler does still think I'm pregnant.
He hasn't asked me how I'm feelingor offered to carry my bags.
I feel bad for the womanwho ends up with him.
After you, of course.
Don't worry.
You only have to bepregnant for a few more hours..   because I'm telling the father today.
Is it someone in the building?That tall guy on the first floor?
No!What?
I think he's cute.
Then you have his baby.Believe me, I'm trying.
It's so weird.You're gonna tell this guy today..   and he has no ideawhat's gonna happen.
You're just gonna knock on his doorand change his life forever.
You're like Ed McMahon,except without the big check.
Or the raw sexual magnetism.
Yeah, well, I guessit is pretty big news.
Pretty big?
It's huge!God, this guy doesn't have a clue.
He's just walking down the street thinking,"I had sex with Rachel Greene.
I rock!"
Then, bam!
He's a father,everything's different.
It's only different if he wants it to be.I'm not gonna ask him for anything.
He still has this huge decisionto make.
Now he's walking around thinking,"Do I want to be a dad?"
Then, bam!
What was that "bam"?
I don't know.He's hit by a bus, or something.
Joey, what would you do if someone youslept with told you she was pregnant?
Who called here?
Did she sound blond?
Did she havean accent?
I gotta make a call.
Should have never walkedinto that Sunglass Hut!
It's not you!You didn't get anybody pregnant.
Why would you scare me like that?What the hell's going on?
Is somebody pregnant?
Oh, yeah!
That's me.
Oh, my God, Pheebs!You're gonna have a baby?
Yes, I am.Oh, my God, I'm gonna have a baby!
Wait a minute, who's the father?You don't know him.
It's not important.
He wants nothingto do with me or the baby.
Who is this guy?
Because I willtrack him down and kick his ass!
David Linn.David Linn!
Who's David Linn?Some guy from my gym.
Little annoying.
Did you do it yet?Not yet.
Then what are you doing here?Are you about to do it?
Is it Gunther?
It's not Gunther!Thank God.
Because that hair on a baby?
The father is not here, okay?I haven't told him yet.
I don't think I can tell him at all now.Why not?
I was walking down the street, thinking,"I'm gonna tell the father."
And then, bam!
Bus?
No, you!
You freaked me out.You kept saying how huge this all is.
But it is huge.
I know.
But I was just thinking abouthow huge it was for me.
I didn't even go to how huge it'll befor the father.
You're thinking about this way too much.Just tell him and get it over with.
It's like ripping off this BandAid,quick and painless.
Watch.
Oh, mother of..!
You know what a really good rainyday game is?
What?
I mean, naked game.
We should totally play strip poker.
No!
Are you crazy?
Come on.
When you go away, you have to play.
It's, like, a law.
Well, it's not a law.
Thank you.
Okay.
Who's next?
No!
No way!
Come on, please.
I'm bored.
You let me do it once before.
Well, if that's the rule this weekend... Get away.
Take it like a man.
Come on!
Big bullies!
How are we doing?
Bored and bored.
You know what naked card game's never boring?
No!
I couldn't find cards, so it was this or Strip Bagofoldknittingstuff.
Done.
"Fonzie gives you two thumbs up.
Collect two cool points."
If you get five points, you get to make someone take off one item of clothing.
It hasn't happened yet, but we're all very excited.
Okay, come on.
Daddy needs a new pair of electromagnetic microscopes... ...for the Prehistoric Forensics department.
Okay.
"Take Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point.
Collect three cool points."
Yeah!
Which gives me five.
And let's see, who is gonna lose their clothes?
I think I pick our strip poker sponsor, Mr. Joey Tribbiani.
All right, relax.
It's just a shoe.
"Your band is playing at Arnold's.
Collect three cool points."
Which means I have five, and that means I get Joey's boxers.
Fine.
Gang up on me.
I got you all right where I want you.
Come on!
Take them off!
Actually, it's kind of cold.
How about I keep my boxers on and give you a peek at the good stuff?
All right, I'm gonna make more margaritas.
What are you doing?
Trying to get me drunk?
I'm just making margaritas.
Think I'll help her out.
What is going on here?
What?
You're painting his toenails.
Come on!
Chasing him around the room.
Please!
He's totally flirting with you too.
He is, isn't he?
I don't know.
Maybe it's just being here at the beach together...
...I don't know, but it's like something... Hi, Bonnie.
Hi.
My boss let me off early, so I took the train.
What are you guys doing?
We're playing Strip Happy Days Game.
Cool!
Well, lucky for you.
What?
I don't know.
Well, is everybody else having just the best time?
Joey's asleep.
After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
Well, I assume the happy couple isn't up yet?
Did you guys hear them last night?
I don't know what they were doing, but... ...sea turtles actually came up to the house.
Good morning.
How'd everybody sleep?
Great.
Like a log.
Us too.
I'm going for a walk.
Good morning.
Nice breasts by the way.
Hey, what happened to you?
How could you lose him?
I don't know!
We were watching TV, then he pooped in Monica's shoe.
Wait.
He pooped in my shoe?
Which one?
I don't know.
The left one!
Which ones?
Those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
Why is the air in here so negative?
Rachel lost Marcel.
Oh, no!
How?
He pooped in my shoe.
Which one?
Those cute black ones I wear all the time.
No, which one?
The right or left?
Because the left one is lucky.
Come on!
What am I gonna do?
All right.
You're a monkey you're loose in the city.
Where do you go?
It's his first time out, so he'll do some of the touristy things.
I'll go to Cats.
You go to the Russian Tea Room.
Oh, my God!
Come on, you guys!
He'll be home any minute.
He'll kill me!
Search the building.
You take the first and second floor.
We'll take third and fourth.
What am I gonna do?
You stay here and just wait by the phone.
Spray Lysol in my shoe and wait for Ross to kill you.
Does anybody want to trade?
What do you want?
Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey.
Have you seen it?
I left a Belgian waffle out here.
Did you take it?
Why'd you leave it in the hall?
I wasn't ready for it.
Sorry.
Marcel?
Hi, can I help you?
We're kind of having an emergency, and we were looking for something.
A monkey.
Yes, have you seen any?
No, I haven't seen a monkey.
Can you fix radiators?
Sure!
Did you try turning the knob back the other way?
Of course!
Oh.
Then, no.
Taste this daiquiri.
Is there too much rum?
Just a second.
Hope you find your monkey.
Oh, no, wait!
We may not know about radiators, per se but we do have expertise in the heating and cooling milieu.
Weren't we in the middle of something?
But these women are very hot and they need our help.
And they're very hot!
We can't, all right?
We're sorry.
You have no idea how sorry.
But we promised to find this monkey.
He's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel.
So if we could get pictures of you, it'd help us out.
From now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
Oh, my God!
What?!
Something just brushed up against my right leg.
Oh, it's okay.
It was just my left leg.
Look, Phoebe!
Oh, Marcel!
Come here!
Step aside, ladies.
What are you gonna do?
Just a small tranquilizer.
Run, Marcel!
Run, Marcel!
Damn!
Are you okay?
I think so.
With the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
Thanks so much for taking me to all those places.
I had a great time.
Oh, I'm glad.
Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though.
I just did not see this coming.
New York is awesome!
What is with you?
You know, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know?
Yeah, you miss a lot when you're mooing.
Thanks so much for showing me around.
Oh, it was our pleasure.
We're so much enjoying getting to know you.
Well, if there's anything else you want to know...   oh.
Uh... okay.
Um, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?
Oh, sure.
Yeah.
Well, he was my high school boyfriend.
Captain of the football team.
Really cute.
And he got a scholarship and went off to college.
That's great.
Yeah, it's almost definitely him..   How's that now?
Well, there's a chance it's another guy.
I mean, I've only ever been with two guys, but they sort of overlapped.
So what does the other guy do?
Does he go to college, too?
No, he's in prison.
Oh.
Was he falsely accused of something?
No,  he killed his father with a shovel.
But other than that, he's a great guy.
I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
Are you awake?
Of course I'm awake!
Assume from now on that I'm always awake!
All right.
We don't know that it's him.
I mean, it could be the football guy.
Honey, it's us!
Of course it's the shovel killer!
All right, let's say that it is him.
Would we not want the baby?
No.
Would you treat him any differently?
I'd keep an eye on him!
We have to find out which one the father is.
How?
I don't know.
They have tests for these things, right?
Yeah, but maybe we're just overreacting.
Easy for you to say.
He's a father killer.
He probably loves his mommy.
He's probably got a tattoo then says "mom"  on his shovelwielding arm.
We'll now count from one to five.
How was lunch?
We had a good time.
By the way,  I wanted to ask you something.
It would really mean a lot to me if the baby was a boy that you name him after my father,   Jiminy billy bob.
Oh, really ?
No!
You were right.
That was fun.
I'm going to go finish packing.
Okay.
So, is she going to take the test?
Nope.
She doesn't have to.
I found out who the father is.
Oh, god.
It's shovely joe, isn't it?
No, it's not.
How do you know?
Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention  in sex ed class   'cause the thing she did with that prison guy?
It'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.
Oh, god, what was it?
The thing we hardly ever do, or the thing we never do?
The thing we never do.
Hmmmmmmm.
The One With the Sonogram at the End No, it's good.
It is good.
It's just that doesn't she seem a little angry?
Well, she has issues.
Does she?
He's out banging other women with a club while she's home getting the mastodon smell out of the carpet.
Marsha, see, these are cave people.
Okay, they have issues like: "Gee, that glacier's getting kind of close! "
See?
Speaking of issues, isn't that your exwife?
Yes, it is.
Carol, hi!
Okay.
Yes, it is.
I'll catch up with you in the Ice Age.
Hi.
So.
You look great.
I hate that.
Sorry.
Thanks.
You look good too.
Well, you know, in here, anyone who stands erect.
So what's new?
Still a.
A lesbian?
You never know.
How's the family?
Marty's still totally paranoid.
Carol, why are you here?
I'm pregnant.
Pregnant!
She didn 't leave in such a hurry after all.
Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
Yeah, it's beautiful!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
No, don't touch that.
Like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough having to return it to him.
"Barry, remember me?
I'm the girl that stomped on your heart in front of your family" Now I must return the ring, without the ring which makes it so much harder.
Easy, we'll find it.
Won't we?
Okay, look.
When did you have it last?
Doy!
Probably right before she lost it.
You don't get a lot of "doy" these days.
I know I had it this morning.
I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with Dinah?
Oh, don't be mad.
You didn't!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I gave you one job!
But look how straight those noodles are.
That's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagna.
I just can't do it.
Boys?
We're going in!
Hi.
That is not a happy "hi. "
Carol's pregnant.
I found it!
Yeah.
Do that for two hours you might be where I am right about now.
That puts that whole pillow thing in perspective.
How do you fit into this whole thing?
Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved.
But if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.
Basically, it's totally up to me.
She is so great.
I miss her.
What does she mean by "involved"?
Presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
Anyway, they want me to go down to this sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
What'll you do?
I have no idea.
No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
This is still ruined, right?
I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.
This is her wedding day  That's way more important than some stupid kids  That's sweet, honey  but save something for the adoption lady   Okay  Alright, okay, be careful  Okay / Careful  Watch her hair.
Watch her hair!
Rach, she's got like three hairs  I know, I know  but they're just so beautiful  Oh my God, I just pulled one out  I promise you she's safe, okay?
Now watch!
Watch how much she loves this.
Okay, okay  Are you ready, sweetie?
Here we go   Okay, careful   She's smiling  Oh, look at that!
She does like it  See?
I told you.
Oh my God!
She's a little daredevil  Oh, God!
Oh, let me push.
Can I push?
Oh, absolutely / Okay   Okay, get, get the camera.
It's, it's in the diaper bag.
Okay   See?
Scared of the swings  I bet you feel pretty silly   We're seriously asking for the money back?
Oh, that's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here  He's great with kids though   Oh, God, Ross.
Oh my God!
Are you okay?
Son of a bitch!
Oh, relax !
I didn't say the F  word.
Ross, see, I told you the swings are evil!
Alright.
That is it!
That is the last time Emma is getting on  one of those things for her entire life  No, no, no, no, no.
Okay.
It wasn't the swing's fault.
It was my fault.
And kind of that kid's fault  who is still laughing.
Nice  Ross, come on, please.
Can we just get out of here  before somebody else gets hurt?
No, wait, okay, okay.
I have an idea.
I want you to get on the swing, okay?
And, and you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.
I know what this is all about.
You've always been jealous of my hair Look, I just think you're an adult, okay?
And you, you should get over your silly fears  Alright, fine!
I'll do it!
/ Good  If you hold the spider.
What?
Where?
Where?
"IF" you hold a spider.
I know   Guys, is everything okay?
I got a spider  There were two.
I picked the bigger one   Okay / Okay   This feels perfectly normal   Okay, get on the swing   Okay   Okay   Okay   See?
Ah, alright.
I can do this  There you go.
Good for you!
You know what?
I'm actually getting used to this little guy  I don't really even feel him in here any more  That's because it's on your neck  What?!
Ross
All right, Pheebs, your cab's ready.
All right.
Let's go.
You're welcome.
I'm sorry.
Were you speaking to me, or sleeping with someone else?
We were on a break!
Why don't you just put that on your answering machine?
It's valid, and I'm not the only one who thinks so.
Monica agrees with me.
What?
I don't know.
You said it last night.
What I said was that I understood.
Joey is the one who agreed with you.
Okay.
Really, Joey?
What?
You know what?
There is no right or wrong here.
I think it's obvious who's wrong here.
Obviously not to Joey.
What?
Joey and Monica feel the way I do!
You and this "innocent puppy" act!
We know that this is really, really hard for you guys.
You know... You don't have to love each other.
You don't even have to like each other much right now.
But please, find a way to be around each other.
And not put us in the middle.
Yeah.
I mean, otherwise, that's just it for us hanging out together.
You know?
Is that what you want?
Can you be civil?
Yeah.
I can.
Good.
Let's get back in the car.
It's freezing, and my chest is unsupported.
Wait a second!
I mean, what are we doing?
Who's going with who?
Look, you guys should go.
No.
You know, you planned this all out, and...
...I don't wanna ruin it.
So you should just go.
You drove all the way up here.
I've got to take the car back anyway.
I'm spending all day tomorrow with Ben.
It's fine, okay?
Just go.
No guilt.
I promise.
Thank you.
We'll call you when we get back.
Maybe we can, like, go to a movie or something.
Or the rodeo!
That would be great.
Okay.
I was being Shelley Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
I know.
Bye!
Ross.
Hi.
Sorry I'm late.
Were you sleeping?
No.
Oh, great, because...
I had to get you a new battery.
I got the best I could.
That's not where you wanna skimp.
You're a genius.
It came to about $ 112.
But what the hell?
Just call it an even 110?
Okay.
I'll pay you tomorrow, Ross.
Bye!
So they all took off.
It was pretty hard watching them go, you know?
Yeah, okay.
Bye.
So I'm gonna take off, then
Hi there.
Hello.
Welcome to Lavender Day Spa.
How may I help you?
Hi.
I have a massage appointment under Rachel Greene.
Okay.
And here is my gift certificate.
This has been torn up.
And taped back together.
Okay.
Well, I'll call you as soon as your massage therapist is ready.
Okay.
Have a seat through the glass doors.
Through the glass doors.
Through the glass doors.
All righty then.
Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room.
Do we have to talk like that when they're not around?
Oh, no.
No, no.
Listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?
Sorry.
Everyone is booked.
That woman can't know I work here.
She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink..   about how awful these massage chains are.
Then why do you work here?
Because it's good money.
But that doesn't change the fact..   that this is an evil, bloodsucking corporate machine.
Well, I think this is a great place to work.
Okay, are they listening?
Hello, ja.
It's time for your massage, ja?
Put your face in the hole.
A Swedish massage from a real Swedish person.
Okay, then I'm Swedish.
So, what's your name?
It's a normal Swedish name.
Ikea.
Wow.
What an interesting name.
Yeah.
You know, I..  Time for your scalp massage.
Wow.
I really love your..    Is something wrong?
No, it's just..
It just feels so good..   Ikea.
Hey, say, you'll know this.
What's the capital of Sweden?
Stockholm.
Damn.
I wish I knew if that was right.
And that's the Swedish national anthem.
Thank you for asking.
Wow, Ikea.
What a rich culture.
You know what?
I have a friend who's a masseuse.
Oh?
Ja, ja?
Ja.
She's not very good, though.
And why do you think that is?
I don't know.
Maybe it's because she's got such callousy fingers..   from playing crummy guitar.
Or maybe she has trouble loosening your knots..   because you're such a highmaintenance tightass.
Phoebe!
You know it's me?
Well, for like a half an hour!
Man, you can lie about Sweden!
How can you come here?
Why didn't you tell me you work here?
I don't have to tell you everything!
You do if you're gonna make me feel guilty for getting a free massage.
Tip's not included.
Why did you lie to me about working here?
Because I was ashamed, okay?
I sold out for the cash.
And they give me benefits, like medical and dental and a fourohwunk.
But, you know, you pay a price.
Now I'm this corporate stooge..   and punching a clock..   and paying taxes!
Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much..   you should walk out there right now and quit.
Be true to what you believe in.
Honey, you have principles, and I so admire that.
I don't have any.
You know what?
You're right.
I am gonna quit.
It's time I took my life back.
Good for you, Phoebe.
If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any of that.
I love you.
Hi.
Relax, Paul.
You're doing great.
She likes you.
I think she likes you.
She likes you.
You know why?
Because you're a neat guy.
You are the man.
You are the man!
Still got it.
Still sexy.
You're just a love machine.
Ross?
Elizabeth!
Okay.
I'm gonna go out this window.
I'll meet you at the front door.
Tell them you're going home.
Okay.
Oh, my God, Ross!
What in heaven's name are you doing here?
And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
Ross, you and I are gonna have to have a little talk.
Daddy, I.. You're next!
Okay.
I didn't know he was here.
Let me just see if I got this straight.
I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I'll have you fired.
What you heard was: "Take my daughter... come up to my country house and ruin my weekend with Rachel."
Please, Paul.
Just let me explain.
No!
Let me explain!
Fired!
Okay, fine.
Fine.
Have me fired.
But I want you to know... that you and I are not all that different.
I mean...
I, too, am a "neat guy."
What?
And I, too... am "just a love machine."
Let me show you the guest room.
So did Hildy show you the place?

Nothing.
It's an acting exercise.
I'm practicing my fake laugh.
What?
What's so funny?
No, no.
There's none of that in here.
Come on, man.
At least let me finish this last one.
Only if you give me a drag.
Okay.
Oh, dark mother, once again I suckle at your smoky teat.
No, why don't you hold on to that one.
Okay, that's like the least fun game ever.
I'm sick of your smoking, so I brought something... ...that is going to help you quit.
Nope.
That patch is no good.
It's a hypnosis tape.
A woman at work used it for two weeks and hasn't smoked since.
What's your problem?
Nothing.
It's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
I watched you get hypnotized in Atlantic City.
That guy did not hypnotize me, okay?
You always pull your pants down and play "Wipe Out" on your butt.
I was trying to distract attention... ...from that poor, old woman who was trying to stuff her breasts into tube socks.
Forget hypnosis.
The way to quit smoking is to dance naked in a field of heather... ...and then bathe in the sweat of six healthy, young men.
Or what my father calls "Thursday night."
You are falling fast asleep.
Deeper, deeper, deeper.
You are now completely asleep.
You don't need to smoke.
Cigarettes don't control you.
You are a strong, confident woman... ...who does not need to smoke.
A strong, confident woman.
Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay.
Hi, Daddy.
Baby.
Ross.
Dr. Greene, how are you?
Thanks for dinner last night.
Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
Nice hair.
What did you do, swim here?
That's it.
I can't take it anymore.
What?
He's interested in you.
He likes your hair.
He just wants to know how you got here.
Oh, please.
It's hopeless.
I'm just gonna go.
What?
Ross...
I'm sorry.
It's just...  Ross?
What's with the neck?
He has this thing.
I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor.
You still going to him?
That man couldn't get into med school in Ixtapa!
Thank you.
That's what I keep saying.
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
Wait a minute.
His name is Dr. Bobby?
That's his last name.
And his first name.
He's Bobby Bobby?
It's Robert Bobby.
And excuse me, he helps me.
Please.
Ask her how.
What do you need help for?
My alignment.
One leg's shorter than the other.
Oh, my God.
Argue with that.
It's true!
My right leg is two inches shorter!
Come on, you're just tilting!
Her legs are fine.
I know that.
So why do you let her go to him?
"Let her"?
She doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance either.
Wait a minute, you don't have renter's insurance?
What if you're robbed?
How will you run after the robber with one leg shorter than the other?
Would you like some juice?
I'd love some juice.
This is going so well!
Did you see us?
Did you see?
Yeah, honey.
I was standing right there.
Why don't you tell him about the mole I haven't checked yet?
Excellent!
There will come a time in each of your careers... ...when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor.
I had such an opportunity in the recent present.
And I'm ashamed to say... ...that I took it.
I advised a fellow actor to play a role... ...homosexually.
We both auditioned for the part... ...and as it turned out... ...they...
They liked the stupid gay thing and cast him.
And now... ...he's got a twoyear contract opposite... ...Susan Lucci... ...the first lady of daytime television.
And me?
Me, I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people... ...most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
May I help you?
Yes, hi.
We spoke earlier.
I'm the lady stuck with the racecar bed.
Look, it's like I told you.
There's nothing I can do.
You signed for it.
"Monica Felula Geller."
All right, jester man, we wanna see the King.
Nobody sees the King.
Okay.
I'm talking to the King.
Hey, you can't go back there!
Oh, my God.
Watch it, lady!
Hey, goodlooking.
All right, I'll leave.
My bed's so boring

We weren't doing anything!
Rach, he just saw us.
Shhh.
But what you saw that, that is the extent of it, okay?
One kiss.
No, come on, that is a lie, we also kissed in Barbados.
Dude, chill!
Oh, okay.
We also kissed in Barbados but  we didn't plan it, okay?
And the only reason that happened was, was   because I saw you kissing Charlie.
Yeah!
You started it!
I have got to chill!
Look, we, we probably should've talked to you about this  before it ever happened but ...   Ah, we feel so terrible about this Ross.
Yeah, but it did happen.
So...   Ross?
Ross?
Can we just close the door?
'Cause you were there for me too~   Ross, say something.
Anything.
So you two are ...   Yeah.
And have you had ...?
No.
No.
no.no.no.
But if I hadn't walked in here, would you ...?
Probably...No!
No!
Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this.
You have every right to go nuts.
I'm not going nuts.
Do you see me going nuts?
No, but you know what I mean?
Hey, hey, hey, ....
If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you.
I'm Fine!
Really?
Absolutely!
I'm fine!
Totally fine!
I..I don't know why it's going out aloud and squeaky   cause really I'm fine!
I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised   to watch you guys kissing I mean at first I was like ...
But now that I've had time to absorb it,   loving this.
Ross,...
It's all working out.
Me and Charlie, and you two.
You know what we should do?
Calm ourselves?
No, we should all have dinner.
Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night.
I'll cook!
Look, don't, don't you think that'll be a little weird?
Weird?
Why?
What's weird?
The only thing weird would be someone didn't like Mexican food  because I'm making FAJITAs!
I do like fajitas.
The One with the Dirty Girl You have any wrapping paper?
Is it for my birthday present?
It was your birthday months ago.
You said you ordered something special and it just hadn't come yet.
I have a call in about that.
It's for Kathy.
It's an early copy of her favorite book.
The Velveteen Rabbit!
When the boy's love makes the rabbit real... Don't touch it because your fingers have destructive oils.
Then you'd better keep it away from Ross' hair.
This is pretty rare.
How did you get that?
No big deal.
I just went to some bookstores... ...talked to some dealers, called some of the author's grandchildren.
Honey, that's so sweet.
What a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend."
It doesn't say that.
Does it?
How will it look when you get her something incredibly meaningful... ...and expensive, and her boyfriend, Joey, gives her an orange?
I'll make sure Joey gets her something really great.
It's got to be better than that book.
Like a crossbow!
Can I borrow your apartment keys?
Why?
You can pee here.
Yes, I can, of course.
It's okay.
The duck's using our bathroom anyway.
What are you getting for her birthday?
We've been dating a couple weeks.
I got to get her something?
You have to get her something really nice.
I know!
And not one of your coupons... ...for an hour of "Joey Love."
A crossword!
Can I help?
No.
Last week I got all but three answers... ...and I want to finish one without any help.
Fine.
But you can't help me develop my new universal language.
You know what we should all do?
Go see a musical.
Sure.
You know which one?
The 1996 Tony Award winner.
I mean, that one's gotta be good.
Do you know the name of that one?
I don't know.
Grease?
Rent?
Yes!
Rent!
So when do you want to go?
What?
I'm sorry.
I can't, I'm busy.
Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
Yes, it is... ...at Office Max!
What did you get her?
A pen.
It's two gifts in one.
It's a pen that's also a clock.
You can't give her that.
Why not?
She's not 11!
And it's not the seventh night of Chanukah.
What he means by that is, while this is a very nice gift... ...maybe it's not something a boyfriend gives.
Sure it is.
She needs a pen for work.
She's writing.
She turns it over.
"It's time for my date with Joey!"
All right.
What did you get for Angela Del Veccio's birthday?
She didn't have one.
For three years?
Look, it's too late, and I got an audition.
I can't shop anymore.
I will go out and try to find something for her.
Thanks, man.
While you're at it, could you get her a card?
Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
Or just get a card that has a poem already in it.
Oh, so it's a card, but it's also a poemholder.
I love what you've done with the place.
I know it's a lot of boxes.
I appreciate you letting me stay here.
Not a problem.
Since you'll be here a while... ...we could put your name on the answering machine.
I hope you don't mind... ...but I kind of already jazzed it up a little.
Check it out.
We will We will call you back Pretty cool.
You're fake laughing too, right?
The tears are real.
We moved the table into my room because of all the boxes.
Come on!
I have one question.
What is the deal with this?
Byebye, little puppet Joey hand?
No, the quiet down thing.
You mean this.
I don't know how much more I can take.
Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with a show about bugs?
My God!
What if that had been porn?
All right, this may be tough... ...but it's Ross.
I survived college with him.
I guess I can hold out a little longer.
Let's have a game.
Fellas?
So he's out of here.
Ninetyeight... ...ninetynine... ...one hundred!
Okay.
Go.
Dude, I'm telling you, I'm fine.
Here we go, here we go.
So I didn't get that apartment.
Some problem with my application.
You're kidding?
But Phoebe said I could stay at her place for a while, so... Well, you can't stay with Phoebe.
We're roomies.
You don't need me taking up all your space.
We got plenty of space.
There's still some by that speaker.
Please, just stay.
Are you sure?
Definitely.
You have to stay.
So I'm a pimp, huh?
It's okay.
Sometimes I can be a pain in the ass.
But just talk to me.
Tell me if something bothers you.
And I'll do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just... Well, I see you've had a very productive day.
The cowboy hat's a little much.
Come on, it's fun!
All right.
Isn't this a woman's hat?
Stop talking crazy, and make us tea
This way!
Hi!
Look out!
Tackled by a girl!
Bet you don't see that every day, do you?
What's with the tackling?
What?
I just touched him and he went over.
Okay.
You wanna play rough?
We can play rough.
We have to do this.
We are playing for women everywhere.
Okay, just think about every lousy date you ever had.
Every guy who kept one eye on the TV while you were making out.
Oh, my God!
You dated someone with a glass eye too?
Come on, okay?
This is for all womankind.
Let's kill them!
Yeah!
Kill them!
All right, well, I want to kill them too.
But they're boys.
You know, how are we gonna beat three boys?
We still have a minute and a half left, and we're down by two points.
Two points, ladies.
All right, Phoebe, get open.
Rachel... ...go long.
Okay.
Break!
I did it!
Touchdown!
We did it!
You know?
Rachel, funny thing, actually.
The end zone starts at that pole.
So you're 5 feet short.
So... ...we win!
Yes, yes, yes!
Wait, so explain something to me, though.
If nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going?
Let me in, let me in!
No way!
Guys, guys, come on.
It's Thanksgiving!
It's not important who wins or loses.
The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me!
Me, not you!
Holland loves Chandler!
Thank you, Amsterdam!
Good night!
This stuffing is amazing.
Should we should bring them some?
When they're hungry, they'll come in.
Let go!
No, you let go!
How come it's always us left on the field, holding the ball?
I don't know.
I guess the other people just don't care enough.
Hey, it's starting to snow.
What are you doing down here?
Nothing
Is he here?!
He's here.
I assume one of you is the father.
That's me.
I'm him.
Actually, we're both the father.
Oh, Ben!
Hey, buddy.
Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
That one has ducks on his Tshirt and this one has clowns.
And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.
Or clowns.
That one's Ben!
Remember he had that cute little mole by his mouth!
Hey, Ben!
Remember us?
Okay, the mole came off.
What are we gonna do?
We'll flip for it.
Ducks or clowns.
Flip for the baby?
You got a better idea?
All right, call it in the air.
Heads.
Heads, it is.
We have to assign heads to something!
Right!
Ducks is heads because ducks have heads.
What kind of scaryass clowns came to your birthday?
Just call me angel Of the morning, angel Just touch my cheek Before you leave me, baby Just call me angel Of the morning, angel Then slowly turn away I won't beg you to stay With me Here.
My little nephew.
Come here, little one!
There's my little baby, Ben!
Hey, he's not crying!
There's still pie!
I'm here.
I'm here.
How's my little boy?
You want Daddy to change your diaper?
I know, I know.
Did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
He rode the bus today.
Big boy riding the bus Hey, I have a question.
How come it says, "Property of Human Services"?
You are gonna love this.
Can you hold Ben for a sec?
Come here.
Come here.
Stay back!
I've got kiwi!
Run, Joey, run!
Smelly cat, smelly cat What are they feeding you?
No, no.
I'm sorry, it's: Smelly cat, smelly cat Better!
Much better.
Good.
Don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.
You want to try it again?
From the top?
There is no "top," all right?
That's the beauty of "Smelly Cat."
Why don't you just follow me.
Smelly cat, smelly cat What are they feeding you?
This is your first Thanksgiving.
What are you thankful for?
Mommy's boobies?
A lot of people are thankful for those.
Hello?
Rachel?
Who is it?
It's your favorite sister.
Jill?
Amy!
Hide my rings.
Amy!
Happy Thanksgiving.
Do you have a hair straightener?
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Hair straightener.
I haven't seen you in, like, a year.
I know.
I know.
I've just been crazed.
Well, me too.
I had a baby.
I decorated Dad's office.
Yeah?
Well, unless you pushed a desk out of your vagina, not the same thing.
About that hair straightener, honey, I really need one.
I'm gonna have dinner at my boyfriend's house.
Oh, my God.
Is this Emmett?
It's Emma.
It's a girl?
Hey, Amy.
Amy, you remember Ross?
Not really.
But you are much cuter than that geeky guy she used to date.
That was me.
No, he was this creepy guy from high school who had this huge crush on her..   since, like, the ninth grade.
Still me.
No, I'm not talking about you.
It was your fat friend's brother with that bad Afro.
Okay, Amy, I'm gonna save you some time, okay?
All me!
She's precious.
Do you ever worry that she's gonna get your real nose?
Amy..
Yes, I do.
I really do.
Hello?
Yeah, hang on, one sec.
Can I take this upstairs?
Sure.
We don't live there, but..
Seriously?
It's just these rooms?
I thought you were a doctor.
Yeah.
No, Ross has a Ph.D.   God, she is unbelievable.
I know.
I mean, a Ph.D. is just as good as an MD.
Sure, Ross, yeah!
If I have a heart attack at a restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush.
Stupid Thanksgiving.
What?
What?
What happened?
My boyfriend canceled on me.
I mean, I finally find a real relationship.
Someone that I can spend this day with, and then his wife comes back into town!
I swear, it's almost not even worth dating married guys.
Don't say that.
God, I was so looking forward to this.
It was gonna be such a beautiful Thanksgiving.
We were gonna have sushi.
Amy, don't cry.
Ross, can I talk to you in private?
Sure, you wanna go upstairs, or..?
Look, I was thinking, if it's okay with Monica..
I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.
I think that's a great idea.
It'll be like the Pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.
Look, I know she's a little tough to take.
But she has nowhere else to go, and she's my sister.
She's Emma's aunt.
And I would like them to bond.
I don't want them bonding too much.
I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.
Ross, she may need one.
We're just gonna have to make our peace with that!
I mean, these things happen.
You're making it sound worse than it was.
Her date tipped me $10!
What are you doing?
I want to be sexy again, so I'm trying to catch a cold.
Should be easy.
They're pretty common.
You'll catch pneumonia!
Okay, you were right.
I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
What?
Are you serious?
How is that possible?
You barely know her.
I don't know.
I just I can't get her out of my head.
I'm a very bad person.
I'm a very, very bad person.
I'm a horrible person.
"No, you're not.
We still love you, Chandler!"
Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.
You mean you stole it!
Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
We were just talking about you.
Really?
The time you got drunk and fell asleep... ...with your head in the toilet.
Right in there!
Ninetynine... ...a hundred.
Ready or not, here I come!
Let's go over the concept one more time.
You want to get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
You know what?
I already ate.
It's 4:30.
I had a big meal on Monday.
So that'll get me straight through the week.
I see what's going on here.
You do?
Yeah.
You don't like Kathy.
You got me.
You've been avoiding her ever since we started going out.
I made an effort to like Janice.
Now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out with us.
Right?
Yeah, right.
Good.
And hey, my treat.
Only because you're not eating, right?
You can see that girl's underwear.
Is she great, or what?
What do you think?
She's not really my type.
Not your type?
She's gorgeous.
You know what it is?
The fishnet stockings.
Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings, it reminds me of... ...my father in fishnet stockings.
Understanding a little more of why you're single.
I have a friend you'd like.
She's really pretty.
And then we could double date.
No, thanks.
I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.
I'm gonna grab a beer.
I'll be right back.
What was that?
What?
Kathy's being really nice and you just walked away.
What do you want from me?
I want you to like her.
If that's too damn difficult for you, then the least you could do is pretend.
I am pretending.
Then do it better.
What do you say I go over there and tell her how much I like her?
I can tell her how much I've been thinking of her.
I haven't stopped thinking about her since we met.
I'm so over the top, wanttoslitmyownthroat... ...in love with her that for every minute...
...I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!
That's pretty good.
But you might want to tone it down a little.
We aren't exactly sleeping in here, but do you mind?
Can I sleep on your couch?
And I'm still waiting For my papiermache man Thank you, my babies.
The tailpipe's not hot enough to light this.
Relax.
I can open this.
Anybody got a coat hanger?
Oh, I do.
No, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
So if your parents hadn't divorced... ...you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it.
One of you give me your bra underwire.
What?!
Come on!
Who has the biggest boobs?
Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra and wire.
No!
It's too expensive!
To get back in the car, we need that wire.
Your call.
Okay.
Monica's are the biggest.
These tiny little nonbreasts?
Please!
Gotta be Rachel.
What?
No, mine are deceptively small.
I mean, I actually sometimes stuff my bra.
Well, then, your bra would still be big.
No, I stuff outside the bra.
Ladies, let's just compromise, okay?
Phoebe, Rachel, take off Monica's bra.
All right, forget it, never mind.
You can have mine.
Thank you.
Chandler, what are you doing?
There is a trash can right there.
I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
Okay.
There.
Wow.
Thank you, Phoebe.
That is very generous.
Wow.
Okay.
Now let's decide who has the nicest ass.
And there you go!
Chandler.
Well, at least let me smoke it to the good part!
Okay.
Oh, no.
Right?
I mean, it's pretty unbelievable.
I mean, they just took off, without even looking back.
You know, I don't need them.
I've got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.
Susan will be so pleased.
Sevenoneseven?
Where's 717?
You have more for Susan, right?
No, but that's okay.
I'll just put out pickles or something.
Ross, thank God!
Pheebs?
Why are you whispering?
I ate a bug.
Hey, Rach!
The tampons here are only a penny.
Let's stock up.
We ran out of gas and don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.
Now you want a favor?
Yes, please.
I'm sorry your car broke down, Pheebs... ...but I'm busy with some real friends right now.
Please call to let me know you got home safely.
Hang on a second.
Take my car.
Go pick up your friends.
No, I won't pick them up.
We both know you'll do it because you're not a jerk.
So you can sulk here, then go pick them up, or save time and sulk in the car.
Rachel doesn't...
I'm sorry Rachel dumped you for Mark... ...and you're innocent.
But don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
Yeah, you're right.
Phoebe, hang on.
Ross wants to tell you something.
What?
You slept with someone else?
We were on a break!
Okay?
We were... We were... Yeah.
Where are you?
I'll find you.
You slept with another woman?
Oh, you're one to talk.
Okay, done.
What's "pleh"?
That's "help" spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air.
What's "dufus" spelled backwards?
Car!
Car!
Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!
Hey!
Hey!
What is he doing here?
He is saving your butt.
Unless I'm stepping on some toes, in which case I could just mosey on.
I've got plenty of people to help on the interstate.
We need your help, please!
Sorry I'm late.
Did you find any apartments in Brooklyn Heights?
No, nothing.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Nothing at all?
No.
If something opens up, we'll move in.
If it has a pool.
I need a pool.
Can I talk to you?
Take a seat.
You okay?
You feel all right?
I feel great, because we're moving in together.
So you... You checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right?
You checked the Post?
Yeah, there was nothing.
Can I get some water?
In a minute.
You checked today's Post?
Yeah, today's.
Because this is today's Post.
And these are the listings I found.
Brooklyn Heights, two bedrooms.
Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom.
Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights!
Oh, are these for rent?
I thought people were just bragging.
Let me tell you what's going on here.
Don't look at the table.
Look at me.
Somebody asked someone to move in with him.
Someone said yes, but now she has doubts... ...because things are moving too fast.
Does that sound possible?
Yes, fine!
I am someone!
You want me to say it?
I have doubts!
I'm sorry!
It's okay that you feel this way.
It is soon, and there's things we don't know about each other.
Everything I know about you, I really like.
Things I don't know, I'll learn in a place with our names on the mailbox.
That's so sweet.
But if it's too soon for you, we don't have to do it.
I want you to be happy.
Living with you would make me happy.
You don't have to say that.
I want to live with you.
I want to move in with you.
Are you sure?
Definitely, yes!
Let's live in an apartment we both live in.
Oh, that's great.
Oh, wait, one sec.
Hey, you!
Behind the glass.
Who are you looking at?
I always wanted to say that every time I was in these rooms, which was never.
I like waking up with you.
I like waking up with you too.
Oh, it's such a beautiful morning.
I could stay here all day.
That would be great.
We could have breakfast in bed.
Wait, just a second.
Oh, no.
All right.
Come on, Monica!
Look alive.
Oh, good.
You're all up.
It's 6:00 in the morning.
Why aren't you at Gary's?
Oh, yeah.
That's over.
Gary's such a great guy.
You can work it out.
He shot a bird.
That is over.
I'm sorry.
That's terrible.
Are you okay?
I'll be all right.
Here, Phoebe.
I don't feel like playing.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It didn't happen.
No one needs to know.
She's not an official ball player.
Only official ball players can drop the ball.
Come on.
Let's go.
You wanna get breakfast?
Okay, let's race!
First one there wins.
You guys wanna eat here?
That was great, huh?
Can you believe how long we threw it?
It is amazing it lasted that long.
My arm is killing me.
No, I meant with the dropper over here.
How did I get this reputation as a dropper?
I am anything but a dropper.
Ross
I want you to know how sorry I am It's okay.
Chandler's the one I'm mad at.
Well, I'm still sorry.
Is he here?
In the box.
He can't talk right now.
Why not?
What's going on?
He's trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
By being in a box?
Joey had reasons.
They were threefold.
You not being able to talk might make this easier.
Listen...
I don't want to be someone who comes between two best friends.
I can't stand seeing what this is doing to you guys.
And I don't want to be the cause of that.
I don't think we can see each other anymore.
I'm going to my mom's in Chicago.
I'm going to stay there for a while.
I think this could have been something really amazing.
But, you know, this is probably for the best.
You know?
I'm going to miss you.
Goodbye, Chandler.
Open the box!
What?
He can still catch her.
Get out of there!
Get out of there!
We're going to be fine.
Get out!
You did some real good thinking in there.
I mean, this is... You could still catch her!
And merry Christmas from your Secret Santa!
All right, who got Chandler?
Because I need to trade.
He sees her!
He's catching up to her.
She sees him!
They're hugging!
He's taking her purse.
That's not them.
I'll go call the police.
There they are!
All right, get a room
How old is that sock?
If I had a sock on my hand for 30 years, it'd be talking too.
I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
Where's Joey?
Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him.
Do you think that was wrong?
I think he's across the hall.
There you go.
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
Pheebs, do you want the rest of that Pop Tart?
Does anyone want the rest of this Pop Tart?
Hey, I might.
I'm sorry.
Those stupid soda people gave me $ 7000 for the thumb.
And on my way over here I stepped in gum.
What is up with the universe?
What's going on?
Nothing.
I think it's nice when we're together.
It's even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.
Please, guys, we have to talk.
Wait, wait!
I'm getting a d??vu.
No, I'm not.
We have to talk.
There it is!
It's about Alan.
There's something you should know.
There's really no easy way to say this.
I've decided to break up with Alan.
Is there somebody else?
It's just you know, things change.
People change.
We didn't change.
So that's it?
It's over?
Just like that?
You let your guard down.
You start to care about someone, and I just.
I can go on pretending.
Okay!
That wouldn't be fair to me, to Alan, or to you.
Well, who wants fair?
I just want things back, you know, the way they were.
I'm sorry.
Oh, she's sorry.
I feel better.
I just can't believe this!
With the holidays coming up.
I wanted him to meet my family.
I'll meet someone else.
There'll be other Alans.
Yeah, right!
Are you guys gonna be okay?
We'll be fine.
We're just gonna need a little time.
I understand.
I'm really sorry.
I mean, I'm sorry too.
But I'm a little relieved.
Relieved?
Well, l mean, l had a great time with you.
I just can't stand your friends.
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?
That was fun.
He could row like a Viking.
So how'd it go?
You know.
Did he mention us?
He says he's really gonna miss you guys.
Rough day, huh?
You have no idea.
Come here.
That's it.
I'm getting cigarettes.
I don't care!
I'm weak!
I've gotta smoke!
I've gotta have the smoke!
If you never smoke again, I'll give you $ 7000.
Yeah, all right
Please don't be a spaceship.
Please don't be a spaceship.
Oh, thank God.
How could you be beeping?
Okay, so this wire... ...is connected to this wire, which plugs into here.
Okay, so to get the beeping to stop, all I have to do... Well done, Pheebs.
What do you want from me?!
Phoebe Buffay?
Fire Alarm?
Oh, hi, Officer Fireman.
Can I help you?
We found your fire alarm in the trash.
That's not mine.
Yes, it is.
How do you know?
Next time you dump a fire alarm... ...don't use a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay, not Monica."
Do you have a search warrant?
Because the last time I checked, this was still America.
Please reattach it.
It's illegal to disconnect them.
Fine.
But please, God, tell me how to stop it from going off?
Press the reset button.
There's a reset button?
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Oh.
Why didn't I see that?
Reset button.
Reset button.
Where is there a reset button?
Oh, here it is!
If it doesn't fit, wear my gray silk one.
Unless I wear it.
You don't know what you're wearing?
I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
Which we have to leave for in 12 minutes.
I'll pick something out for you.
There!
There!
That looks good.
Ross, that's a towel!
You will notice that I am fully dressed.
I, in turn, have noticed that you are not.
So in the words of A.A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dillhole."
Okay.
What are you doing?
You said to give you the chair.
You didn't say anything about cushions.
They're the essence of the chair!
I'm taking the essence.
Oh, he'll be back.
Oh, there's nobody in the room.
I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
That was a Halloween costume.
Unless you would like me to go as Little Bo Peep.
I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
Which, by the way, Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
Rach, good!
Listen, isn't this perfect for me?
Oh, it's perfect!
But not for tonight.
Of course, not for tonight.
Hi.
I'm going to a benefit.
Not for tonight?
What are you doing?
No, I'm sorry.
We didn't mean it.
I love you.
Breathe.
We used them as pillows when we went camping.
What?
The sheep.
Hey, what you do on your own time... Where's my underwear?
Come on, you took his underwear?
He took my essence!
Okay, hold on.
Why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?
Because I'm not wearing any underwear now.
Why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
It's a rented tux, okay?
I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
Then somebody's gonna have to give somebody back his cushions.
Okay.
You hide my clothes, I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
What, are you gonna show me my clothes?
Hey, opposite... ...is opposite.
He's got nothing!
Okay, I'm ready.
Rachel didn't have anything I liked but this ribbon.
I thought, all right, I'll be political.
What are you supporting?
Christmas.
Hey, that's okay with me.
Two down, and I have exactly 12 minutes... What?
My watch stopped.
My watch.
Okay, see... ...the dinosaur tail isn't going around anymore.
What time is it?
It's 7:33.
I have seven minutes.
I have seven minutes!
Which shoes should I wear?
The black or the purple?
Just pick one, okay?
Oh, okay, okay.
The black.
Do you have black with little strappies?
Yeah.
But those go better with pants.
Maybe I should wear pants.
Yeah, pants!
What an idea!
Or better yet, go without pants.
I don't know what you're doing, but just get in there... ...and pick out any shoes that fit your feet.
I don't care if they match.
I don't care if they make... ...your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat.
Just do it!
Go in there, pick something out so we can go.
All right.
Thank you.
Michelle?
Yeah, that was me.
I dialed your number by mistake.
Just try to be... You're so sweet.
Yeah, we were a great couple.
I know, I really miss him.
Well, you know how it is.
It's just that... You know what's weird?
Donald Duck never wore pants.
But when he gets out of the shower... ...he always puts a towel around his waist.
I mean, what is that about?
I only beeped in so I could hear my own message.
I mean, that's allowed.
I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't tell your dad about... What do you mean, you don't feel comfortable with this?
We're friends!
That bitch always hated me.
I'm calling her back.
Okay, fine.
Okay.
She's got a phone in there, right?
Okay, we're on it.
I'm going commando too.
What's this book about?
You didn't read it, either?
I was going to, but I accidentally read something else.
Vogue.
So tell me about Jane Eyre.
No, read it yourself.
Come on, don't be such a goodygoody.
Fine.
All right.
So, Jane Eyre?
First, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not.
She's a cyborg.
A cyborg?
Isn't that like a robot?
This book was light years ahead of its time.
Sorry I'm late.
Let's get started.
What did you think of Jane Eyre?
Rachel and I were discussing it, and she had very interesting insights.
Go ahead, Rachel.
Thank you, Phoebe.
What struck me most when reading Jane Eyre... ...was how the book was so ahead of its time.
If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
Well, feminism, yes.
But also the robots.
Since that video camera thing didn't work out...
...I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
You're naked!
I know!
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
Why?
On account of my rage.
Which, if I may say, right now is out of control.
He gave me a pill for it.
A pill?
When the psychiatrist told me to take a leave of absence... ...because I yelled at my boss, I started to get worked up again.
So he offered me a tranquilizer.
And I thought it was a good idea.
So I took it.
They're making you take time off work?
And you're okay with that?
I don't know.
It's going to be weird not having a job for a while.
But I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
I hate it when they make me see the shrink at my office.
It's so embarrassing!
I can't believe you let me go on like that!
I'm sorry.
It was so funny when you compared Jane Eyre to Robocop.
That was not funny!
I snapped, okay?
You weren't taking the class seriously.
Come on!
What is the big deal?
I thought it'd be something we could do together.
I thought it would be fun.
Fun is good.
But I also wanted to learn.
People talk about what they learned in high school.
I never went.
So you really wanted to learn.
You know, Phoebe, I just wanted to have fun.
You know who should go?
I know!
I know!
I know!
Monica, you asked the question.
You were making a good point.
I mean, till you got cut off.
What's up with that girl Monica?
I don't know.
I didn't come with her.
Hey, everybody!
Everybody, guess what!
I just convinced Carl to give us a test.
Test?
Come on!
Tests make us all better learners!
Oh, yeah!
We should have essay questions
I didn't get a cat.
That's interesting.
No, it's not "interesting."
It's very, very not interesting.
It's actually 100% the opposite of interesting.
I got it, Ross.
You had no right to say you had feelings for me.
I was doing great with Julie before I knew!
I was doing great before I knew about you!
You think it's easy to see you with Julie?
You should've said something before!
I didn't know then.
And how come you never said anything?
There was never a good time.
You only had a year.
And we only hung out every night!
Not... ...every night.
It's not like I didn't try.
But things got in the way.
You know, like Italian guys... ...or exfiances... ...or Italian guys.
There was one Italian guy, okay?
And do you have a point?
The point is, I don't need this right now!
Okay?
It's too late.
I'm with somebody else.
I'm happy.
This ship has sailed!
You're just gonna put away your feelings for me?
I've done it since ninth grade.
I'm good at it.
All right, fine.
You go ahead and do that.
You know, I try to stay positive.
I went to have pizza.
With Danny.
What happened?
That yeti is one smooth talker.
Yetis are smoothtalkers.
Dinner's almost ready.
I think I'll probably just hang out in my room.
Why?
Come on, you guys!
If Emily knew I was having dinner with you, she'd flip out.
It's okay.
I really don't mind.
Wait, wait.
You know what?
Just stay.
Please.
It would mean a lot for me if you stay.
Ross, I just Please, just have dinner with us!
Settle down.
All right.
I'm sorry.
You see, Rach, I'm an actor.
Hey, look!
Ugly Naked Guy's back.
We haven't seen him in so long.
Oh, God!
I really missed that fat bastard.
This is so weird.
I realized this may be the last time we hang out together.
It's almost as if he knew.
I'll get it.
Hi, Emily.
You tracked him down.
Hold on.
Yeah, we're just having dinner.
Sure, hold on.
She wants to say hi.
Hi, Emily!
Hello, everyone.
So who am I saying hello to?
Well, I don't know about who's here... ...but I can tell you who's not here, and that's Rachel!
I should hope not.
Ross knows better than that by now.
You know what?
Rachel is here.
She's there?
Oh, yeah, there she is!
She's here.
Take me off speakerphone.
How could you do this to me?
I made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear.
I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?
You can't keep away from her.
That's ridiculous.
Hello?
Hello?
Who is this?
It's Ross.
What are you doing?
I have never cheated on you.
I'm moving for you.
I'm cutting friends out of my life for you.
Please, get on the plane and come to New York, okay?
You're the only one I want to be with.
I'll feel better when I'm there.
I can know where you are all the time.
You can't know where I am all the time.
This marriage will never work if you don't trust me.
You're right.
Can you trust me?
I think it's going okay.
I guess that's it.
Why?
What happened?
My marriage is over.
Look at you, you're shivering.
Here.
Honey, is there anything we can do?
You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
Stop tormenting me!
This is mink, okay?
They're mean, and they hate squirrels.
Most of these probably wanted to be coats.
Fine.
No, I get it.
Here.
You take it.
Are you happy now?
I'm cold
Hey, by the way, did you just get  on the plane?/  Yeah.
For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.
/ Yay.
Uh, Rach, hang on.
Phoebe?
Is everything okay?
Uhm, actually no.
No, you've... You have to  get off the plane.
What?
Why?
I have this feeling that  something's wrong with it.
Something is wrong with  the left Philange.
Oh, honey, I'm sure there's  nothing wrong with the plane.
Alright, look, I have to go.
I love you, and I will call you  the minute I get to Paris.
Uhm, what was that?
Oh, that was just my crazy friend.
She told me I should get off the plane, because she had a feeling   that there was something wrong with the left Philange.
Okay, that doesn't sound good.
I wouldn't worry about it.
She's always coming up with stuff like this, and you know what?
She's almost never right.
But she is sometimes.
Well...
Wait, what are you doing?
Well, I can't take this plane now.
Excuse me, sir, where are you going?
/  I have to get off this plane, okay?
Her friend has a feeling something's  wrong with the left Philange.
Could I get some peanuts?
What's wrong with the plane?
There's nothing wrong with the plane.
Yeah!
The left Philange!
There is no Philange!
Oh my God.
This plane doesn't  even have a Philange!
I'm not flying on it!
Ma'am, please sit down!
What's going on?
We're all getting off.
There is no Philange!
This is ridiculous!
I...   Yeah, okay.
Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine.
And you fixed the Philange?
Yes, the Philange is fixed.
As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot  of extra Philanges onboard, just in case.
Where is she?
I don't see her.
Rachel!
Rachel Green!
There she is!
Rachel!
Rachel!
Wow, excuse me, sir,  do you have a boarding pass?
No, no,  I just have to talk to someone.
I'm sorry, you cannot go any  further without a boarding pass.
No, no, no, but...
RACHEL!!
Oh my God... What..  What are you guys doing here?
Okay, you're on.
What?
What?
Ross, you're  scaring me.
What's going on?
Okay, the thing is../  Yeah?
Don't go.
What?
Please, please stay with me.
I am so in love with you.
Please, don't go.
Oh my God.
I know, I know.
I shouldn't have  waited 'till now to say it,  That was stupid, okay?
I'm sorry,   but I'm telling you now.
I love you.
Do not get on this plane.
Miss?
Are you boarding the plane?
Hey, hey.
I know you love me.
I know you do.
Miss?
I  I have to get on the plane.
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.
/  No, you don't.
They're waiting for me, Ross.
I can't do this right now, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Rachel?
I'm so sorry.
I really thought she'd stay.
I'm sorry.
So did you guys make it in time?
How you holding up there, big tiger?
Sorry.
When my parents were getting divorced, I got a lot of "tigers."
I got a lot of "champs," "chiefs," "sports."
I even got a "governor."
This is it, isn't it?
This is what my life will be like.
My mom there, my dad there.
Thanksgiving, Christmas.
She gets the house, he's in a condo my sister will decorate with wicker.
How did you get through this?
I relied on a carefully regimented program... ...of denial... ...and wetting the bed.
You know, I just It's so weird.
I mean, I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other.
All I kept thinking about was the Fourth of July.
Because it reminded you of the way... ...our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
It's just this thing.
Every year we would... ...go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks.
Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big.
My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side... ...and Dad would be upset because nobody helping.
And when we did help, he'd scream at us for doing it wrong.
But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up.
You know, and it'd get really cold.
And we'd all just sort of smoosh under this one blanket.
It never occurred to anybody to bring another one.
And now it's... Yeah, I know.
Thanks for coming.
I hope you had fun.
All right, I'm hitting the road.
Now, I've left my 10 verbs on the table.
Be sure and send me that finished poem.
Okay, will do.
Glad you came.
I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
Let me go check.
Your mom wants to say goodbye.
Happy birthday, sweetie.
You drive safe.
What are you doing?
I'm getting ready for the water skiing.
Okay, big hug.
Where are you going?
To get my coat.
We'll get that for you.
All right, all right.
I can get my own coat.
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
Oh, no.
No, you're not supposed to be here.
This is the staging area.
It's all wrong.
You should leave.
You know, just get out.
Or perhaps you'd like a creme de menthe.
I have to be heading toward my chateau.
I guess we're going back into the hallway again.
Thanks for coming, Mrs. Greene.
You take care.
Oh, you kids.
Well.
This is the best party I've been to in years.
Thank you!
Okay, everybody, it's time for flan!
Yep!
Get ready for the gelatinous fun.
Looks like that stuff you get when you get an infection.
Okay, that's enough.
Okay, Rachel, make a special flan wish.
Okay, I've got one.
Heads up!
Wow!
Those things almost never come true
I love this artichoke thing.
Don't tell me what's in it.
The diet starts tomorrow.
You remember Janice.
Vividly.
Hi, I'm Sandy.
Sandy, hi.
Come on in.
You brought your kids.
Yeah.
That's okay, right?
Party!
That thing is not coming in here!
"That thing"?
This is how you greet guests at a party?
If I showed up with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome?
Your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
He was more embarrassed about that than anyone.
And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened.
All right.
All right.
Just keep him away from me.
Thank you.
Come on, Marcel.
What do you say you and I do a little mingling?
All right I'll catch up with you later.
Oh, my God!
Rachel, honey are you okay?
Where's Paolo?
Rome.
Jerk missed his flight.
And then your face exploded?
So as I'm going to get into a cab, she tackles me!
And I hit my head on the curb and cut my lip on my whistle.
Are people eating my dip?
When I saw you at the store last week it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.
Wow, that's dirty!
Hey, kids.
Look at him.
I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me but at least check in.
There you are!
You got away from me.
But you found me.
Here, Ross, take our picture.
Smile.
You're on Janice Camera.
Kill me.
Kill me now.
Everybody, it's Fun Bobby!
Hey, sorry I'm late.
But my grandfather died about two hours ago.
But I couldn't get a flight out till tomorrow, so here I am.
Hey, Fun Bobby!
How's it going, man?
Whoa!
Who died?
It's going to be an open casket, you know?
So at least I'll get to see him again.
I'm gonna blow this one up and I'm gonna write "Reunited" in glitter.
All right, Janice, that's it!
When I invited you, I didn't think it meant that we.
Oh, no!
I'm sorry you misunderstood.
Oh, my God!
You listen to me!
You listen to me!
Four, three, two, one!
Happy New Year!
This place is really beautiful.
I've been coming here since I was a kid.
This used to be my grandma's.
The only thing I got from my grandmother was her eyes.
I mean, not her actual eyeballs.
But people say that my eyes look... Do you wanna make out?
Sure.
Are you okay?
What's wrong?
Yeah.
I was just thinking about your father.
Well, whatever works for you.
No.
He just really freaked me out before.
So we have to hide our relationship from one more person.
Big deal.
Besides, we've had fun hiding it.
Yeah.
Yeah?
You brought protection, right?
Why, are there, like, bears or something?
Protection.
Yeah.
No, yeah.
That.. That I forgot.
I'll run to the store and get some.
I'm the guy.
I'll get it.
Do you know where the store is?
No.
Do you wanna ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
A little bit.
I'll be back in 10 minutes.
Get in the hot tub and I'll meet you there.
Okay.
Oh, my God!
What a great surprise!
It's so secluded up here.
I know.
That's why I like it here.
I feel like we're the only two people in the world.
Sorry.
What's the matter, honey?
Did you see a little mouse?
No!
Big bear!
Big bear outside!
I think I.. Actually, would you go check on that?
We don't have any bears here.
Well, okay.
Would you get me a Diet Coke?
Okay.
Be right back.
Okay.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I came with Paul!
Yeah.
I recognized the ankles.
Where is Elizabeth?
Here you go, honey.
Thank you!
Diet Coke.
Ice.
I need ice.
Okay.
Thank you.
Be right back.
Okay.
You and your ice.
Get out!
Get out!
Go!
Come on!
No, not in there!
Not in there!
He's in there!
Did you really hear a bear?
Go!
Here you go, honey.
One Diet Coke with ice.
Thank you.
I am so happy that you're here.
Here I am!
Elizabeth!
Look!
Elizabeth's here!
Who were you talking to?
You guys?
How did you know we were here?
She obviously saw the tire tracks leading up to the closed garage.
Obviously.
What are you doing here?
Did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
Yeah.
Well, why don't you go in that room and do your homework?
I wouldn't do it in there.
That's my dad's bedroom.
That's your dad's bedroom.
That's your dad's bedroom!
Why are you yelling?
Right here.
It's not true.
I never called your mother a wolverine.
You did so.
I swear.
I swear to.
How long has she been in the bathroom?
I don't think she's in the bathroom.
Her coat is gone.
Well, maybe it's cold in there.
Maybe I screwed up the first date I had in nine years.
That could be it.
Oh, God.
You know, this is still pretty hot.
Mushroom.
Smile.
They won't all be like this.
Some might even stay through dinner.
I'm sorry.
That's not funny.
No, it's just.
Well, you know the whole gettingonwithyourlife thing?
Well, do I have to?
I mean, well, I'm sitting here with this cute woman and she's perfectly nice, you know?
But there's.
That's it.
And then I'm here talking to you, and it's easy and it's fun.
And I don't have to.
I know.
You know?
Here's a wacky thought.
Let's say you and I give it another shot.
I know what you're gonna say.
You're a lesbian.
But what do you say we just put that aside for now, you know?
Let's just stick a pin in it, okay?
Because we're great together, you know?
You can't deny it.
And besides, you're carrying my baby.
I mean, how perfect is that?
You keep saying that, but there's something right here.
I love you.
I love you too.
But.
No "but. "
No "but. "
You know that thing they put over here with the pin in it?
It's time to take the pin out.
You'll find someone, I know you will.
The right woman is waiting for you.
It's easy for you to say.
You found one already.
All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
Not her.
Oh, my God!
Has someone taken your order?
Oh, yeah.
She did.
He did.
She?
I'm sorry, I'm new.
I don't...
I just ordered a beer.
You're straight.
I get it.
If we called your dad, we'd have better seats.
Here we go.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome the incomparable... ...Helena Handbasket.
Hello, darlings.
And there's Daddy.
Switch places with me.
That can't be your father.
I've been saying that for years.
Oh, my God!
What?
That's Mr. Garibaldi playing the piano.
Hello, and welcome to the show.
I see some of our regulars in the audience.
And a couple of irregulars.
He's coming into the audience.
Relax.
You'll be fine.
Oh, much better.
You're invisible now.
Where are you from?
Bakersfield.
I'm sorry?
Bakersfield.
No, no, I heard.
I'm just sorry.
It can't happen like this.
I'll meet you back at the hotel.
Look, a standing ovation already.
So early in the show.
Turn around, darling.
Let me see your pretty face.
Can we have our drinks, please?
Waiter?...tress?
What's your name?
Chandler.
Chandler?
What an unusual name.
You must have had terribly fascinating parents.
Oh, they're a hoot.
And who is your friend?
I'm Monica.
Monica.
Where are you from?
New York.
I'm not very fond of New York.
Queens, I like.
What is this... ...sparkling something, honey, huh?
Actually, Monica and I are engaged.
Really?
Congratulations.
When's the big day?
In two weeks.
I see.
Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness.
So, you're bald.
Wait, wait.
We'd love it if you could be there.
Really?
I know it would make me happy... ...ma'am.
Then I wouldn't miss it for the world.
I'm getting all misty here.
You'd think I was having my legs waxed or something.
You okay?
Yeah.
Thanks for making me do this.
Before we go on with the show, I want to say to the bride and groom... ...how lucky they are to have found each other.
In every life a little rain must fall.
Fortunately... ...in my life...
When I was growing up, I played the one on the far left.
I think you've had enough fun for today.
My God, these pants!
I'm burning up.
Oh God!
She wants to snuggle now?
Is she trying to kill me?
It's like a volcano in here!
Are you hot?
No.
It must just be me, then.
That was just the pants and the couch.
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Go ahead.
Thanks.
My favorite part's coming up!
Oh, my God!
I wasn't learning anything from her Look I feel bad, too Forget it, we're going around in circles.
Joey, it's Ross.
I need some help.
Chandler's not here.
You can help me.
I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom.
Nice!
No, I got really hot in my pants, so I took them off.
But they must have shrunk from the sweat.
Or my legs expanded from the heat.
I can't get them back on, Joey.
I can't!
That is quite a situation.
Do you see any powder?
Powder!
Yeah, I have powder.
Good, good.
Sprinkle some on.
It'll absorb moisture.
Then you can get your pants on.
Sure, throw some of that on there.
Hold on.
Sounds like it's working.
They're still not coming on, man.
And the lotion and the powder have made a paste.
Really.
What color is it?
What difference does that make?
If the paste matches the pants, you can make paste pants... ...and she won't know!
Do you have a minute?
Dude, what am I Rachel's here, so good luck.
Let me know how it goes.
So I pick up the phone I'm not listening to you!
You've been in there for a long time.
I'm starting to get kind of freaked out.
All right, I'm coming out.
Hey, can you turn the lights off?
Let's just leave the lights on.
Oh, my God!
And Hornswoggle?
What, are you dating a character from Fraggle Rock
Can you hear that?
That'll stop when you pick up the phone.
Oh, I'm on!
Mr. Bing's office.
I'm sorry he's in a meeting right now.
I'm not in a meeting.
Will he know what this is in reference to?
And he has your number?
I'II see that he gets the message.
Byebye!
Ross says hi.
This is so fun!
What do we do now?
Well, now I actually have to get to work.
"Most likely. "
Okay, I'm gonna be out there.
AII right.
They don't Like you.
What?
I thought you knew.
Who doesn't Like me?
Everyone.
Except for.
No.
Everyone.
What are you talking about?
Don't feel bad.
You know, they used to Like you a Lot.
But you got promoted, and now you're Mr. Boss Man.
You know, Mr. Big.
Mr. Bing.
Boss Man Bing.
I can't believe it.
Yeah.
They even do you.
They "do" me?
You know, Like, okay.
"Could that report be any Later?"
I don't sound Like that.
Yeah, you do.
"The hills are alive with the sound of music. "
"My scone!
My scone! "
I don't sound Like that.
That is so not true.
That is so not.
That is so not.
That.
Oh, shut up!
Did not!
I'm telling you, up until I was 9 I thought gunpoint was a place where crimes happened.
I gotta go.
Head rush.
One more, and then I have to go.
Cool.
Where you going?
A birthday party with some work people.
Work people?
Nobody told me.
No, I know.
That's part of the whole themnotlikingyou extravaganza.
I don't get it.
A month ago, these people were my friends.
Just because I'm in charge, I'm not a different person.
Then come, hang out.
Let them see what a great guy you still are.
You think I should?
I really do.
But could we not go together?
I don't wanna be the geek who invited the boss.
Last night was great.
You know, the karaoke thing?
Tracy and I doing "Ebony and Ivory. "
You were great!
But they still made fun of you.
What?
Now you're Mr. Caring Boss.
Mr.
I'moneofyou Boss.
Mr. Iwannabeyourbuddy.
Boss Man Bing!
Then I don't get it.
Well, you know what, Chandler?
I think you just gotta face it.
You're, Like, the guy in the big office.
You're the one that hires them and fires them.
They say you're a great boss.
They do?
But they're not your friends anymore.
I just want.
But you can't.
But I just want.
Or, Like, "Could these margaritas be any stronger?"
Hey, Chandler.
Hello, Mr. Bing.
Loved your Stevie Wonder Last night.
Thanks.
About the weekly numbers I'm gonna need them on my desk by 9:00.
Sure.
No problem.
You have to give them something.
That was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the mustache?
Petrie.
Petrie.
Right, okay.
Well, some people are gonna be working this weekend.
Oh, that's nice.
But no!
How does that explain my underwear at your place?
Everybody calm down, okay?
Let's give our friend a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
I am not a pervert, okay?
It's just...
I just kind of...
I think I can explain this.
Thank you.
Joey's a sex addict.
What?!
No, I'm not!
It's okay!
It's good!
It's a disease.
I am not a sex addict!
Yes, you are!
That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
No, it isn't.
It's not.
Because you could also explain it with the truth!
What is the truth?
What's up?
What's going on?
I slept with Monica.
Well, let's see what everybody thinks of that.
You slept with my sister?
Yes, but it was We just did it once, in London.
This is not good for my rage.
Is this true?
Of course, it's true.
How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
Yes, it's true.
If it happened once, how come we found your underwear in our apartment?
That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London.
Right, Monica?
I guess I wanted to keep it... ...as a souvenir.
My God, Monica!
Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica.
She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
That's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
That makes sense.
And the video camera?
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
But, sadly, I could not be enticed.
Monica, this has to stop now.
I'll give it my best shot.
Good luck.
Unbelievable!
You really kept Joey's underwear?
Why?
Why would you do that?
I'm Monica.
I'm disgusting.
I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
I think we've all learned who's disgusting and who's not.
Now, I'm going to get back to my bucket.
I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
You were making a good point.
I love her.
I'll be back in a minute.
Okay.
See?
I told you.She stole my jeans!
What?
I've been looking for them all week,and she is wearing them.
So she stole your pants and thencame back and wore them in front of you?
Don't you see?It's the perfect crime!
She must have beenplanning this for years!
I'll prove it to you, okay.
I dropped a pen in my lap, and it leftan ink stain on the crotch.
When she comes back, I will find itand show you that stain!
Isn't it possible the company that soldthe jeans made more than just the one pair?
Nice jeans.Oh, thanks.
I like your top.Oh.
You're not getting it.
What happened?Oh.
I fell asleep!
I was thinking about takingmy lunch break.
Will you do the top of the cabinets?That'll work up your appetite for lunch.
All right.
Hello.
What's going on?
I'm sorry.
I've never had a maidbefore.
Hey.
I think Brenda needs a raise.How come?
Because I put my headbetween her legs.
To see her pants?They're my pants!
Are you sure?Did you see the stain?
No.
I was getting into position,and then everything went dark.
She is not stealing from us, okay.Will you let this go?
Fine.
She's wearing my bra!Oh, dear God!
My pink, flowered bra!I recognize the strap!
Yet you don't recognizethat you're crazy?
Here's the plan.
I'm going to leave,and you're gonna look at Brenda's bra.
Here's another plan.
No.
I would do it, but she thinksI'm attracted to her.
Why?Did you not hear where my head was?
We're a team.We're in this together.
I fear a jury will see itthe same way.
Do this for me.
I catch you lookingat women's breasts all the time.
You see that?
Do you see this?
All right, yes.Okay.
I get your point.
But if it's not her bra, will youjust let the woman clean?
Yes.
You'll know it's mine because onthe right cup, there's a very noticeable rip.
You need new clothes.
What are you doing?I'm leaning.
This is where I lean.
Okay.
Brenda, a bee!What?
It's flown into your blouse, and you betterundo your buttons lest it sting you.
I think I know what's going on here.You do?
Look, I know it must be hardthat your wife is a lesbian..   but it's wrong.
You're married.
I totally understand.Okay, good.
Could I just see your bra?
Hi.
Where'd you get those jeans?You gave them to me.
No, I didn't!All right, I took them.
I figured it'd be okay becauseyou've got a big ink stain on the crotch.
Oh, no!
Did you take my bra too?What bra?
The pink one with the flowers.You mean the one you're wearing?
Because her dying wishwas for one last kiss.
Joey, when I saw him get off that plane with her...
...I really thought I just hit rock bottom.
But today, it's like there's rock bottom... ...50 feet of crap... ...then me.
Tell Ross how you feel.
Come on, how can I just tell him?
What about Julie?
What about her?
They've only been going out for two weeks.
Ross has been in love with you for 10 years.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I've been with my share of women.
I've been with a lot of people's share of women.
But the point is...
...I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
Really?
Yo, paisan!
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Your tailor... ...is a very bad man!
What are you talking about?
Hey, what's going on?
Joey's tailor... ...took advantage of me.
No way!
I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
He said he was gonna do my inseam.
Then he ran his hand up my leg and then there was definite What?
Cupping.
That's how they do pants!
First they go up one side, they move it over.
Then they go up the other side, move it back, then they do the rear.
Ross, tell him.
Isn't that how a tailor measures pants?
Yes, yes, it is.
In prison!
What's the matter with you?
What?
That's not?
Oh, my God!
What's going on?
Well, okay, first of all... ...Paolo and I are not back together.
That was a stupid thing I did.
If I could go back in time and do it again... ...well, I wouldn't.
Second of all... What?
Is this one of those things where you break up with a guy...
...I tell you what I think... ...and the next day you get back together with him... ...and I look like a complete idiot?
Well, then, I think the guy's scum.
I hate him.
I mean, I actually I physically hate him.
I always have.
And you are way too good to be with a guy like that.
Really?
You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you... ...and who gets how funny... ...and sweet and amazing... ...and adorable and sexy you are.
You know?
Someone who wakes up every morning thinking: "Oh, my God.
I'm with Rachel!"
You know?
Someone who makes you feel good.
Like the way I do with Julie.
Was there a "second of all"?
No, I think that was the whole "all."
I gotta go.
Thanks.
No, I swear to God, Dad!
That's not how they measure pants!
I was thinking of doing it shorter, like Andie MacDowell's haircut.
Hey, Rach.
How'd it go?
You know, it was actually really great.
Took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room.
I had that chicken, where you poke it and butter squirts out.
Not a good day for birds.
Then we took a walk to Bendel's.
And I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel.
That's nice.
Now was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending flowers and to leave you alone?
Right.
Well, we never actually got to that.
It was just so nice to see him again, you know?
It was comfortable and it was familiar.
It was just nice.
That's nice twice.
What's going on?
Isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
Where have you been?
But it was different with him today.
He wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, you know?
I mean, we had fun!
Is there anything wrong with that?
Why?
I have my reasons.
How about the fact that he's engaged to another woman who happens to be your exbest friend?
All right, all right!
I know it's stupid.
I'll go see him this afternoon and I'll put an end to it.
I'm not crazy, right?
I mean, it was never like that.
No, it wasn't!
It was so nice having this little sink here.
"Oh, Danielle, I wasn't expecting the machine.
I just.
Oh, Barry, this was not good.
No, it was.
It was very, very good.
What about Mindy?
Oh, way better than Mindy.
Not that!
I mean, what about you and Mindy?
Oh.
If you want, I'll just break it off with her.
No, don't do that.
Not for me.
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
Thanks, Bernice.
Let's go away this weekend.
Come on.
This is all way too.
No, we can go to Aruba.
When I went there on what would've been our honeymoon it was really nice.
You would've liked it.
I had a bra.
Hey, Dr. Farber.
All right, Miss Greene, everything looks fine.
We're starting to see some real progress here.
What?
I'm 12, I'm not stupid.
Can I use your phone?
So how'd he take it?
Pretty well, actually.
How come you have dental floss in your hair?
Oh, do I?
We ended up having sex in his chair.
You had sex in his chair?
I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
You had what?
Sex in his chair.
What.
What were you thinking?
I don't know.
We still care about each other.
There's a history there.
It's like you and Carol.
It's nothing like me and Carol.
Please!
If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch right here, right now," what would you say?
If it helps I could slide over.
It's a totally different situation.
It's apples and oranges.
It's orthodontists and lesbians.
I gotta go.
Where are you going?
I just have to go!
Do I need a reason?
I have things to do with my life.
I have a jampacked schedule.
And I am late for keeping up with it, okay?
Not under here!
You didn't find her?
I've looked everywhere.
You couldn't have, or you would've found her.
Keep looking!
Yeah!
For about 30 minutes?
Or 45?
In 45 minutes, you could find her twice.
For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't, because I kept moving.
From now on, I'm staying in one place.
Right here.
It's getting late.
We're going to go.
Do you guys mind staying here for a while?
We've got to get up early and catch that plane.
Yeah, it's a very large plane.
That's cool.
But we'll stay here with you.
Thanks, guys!
I really appreciate this, but you don't need to rub my butt.
We have to leave in an hour.
I know.
I've been looking at those doors.
They look pretty soundproof, don't you think?
We can't do that.
That's insane.
I mean, A, he could wake up.
And B, you know... ...let's go for it.
Nope.
She's not with us.
We've come for her things.
Where is she?
She's in hiding.
She's humiliated.
She doesn't want to see you again.
We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey.
But I think you're absolutely delicious!
Excuse me, I'm standing right here.
Oh, yes.
There you are.
Hurry up!
Get some!
There's a whole cart outside.
Goodbye, Geller.
Now, hold on.
Hold on.
Your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon.
Tell her I'll be at that airport, and I hope she will too.
I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything.
She's just a friend.
Tell Emily I love her and...
...I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else.
Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
All right, I'll tell her.
Come on, bugger face!
Call me.
You spend your life in the bathroom.
Why do you never go out the window?
Maybe it's best we never got to do it again.
Yeah, it kind of makes that one night special.
Technically, we still are over international waters.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Maybe I'll see you there?
Can I ask you something?
Felicity and I watched My Giant.
And I thought: "I'll never be as good an actor as that giant."
Do you think I'm wasting my life with this acting thing?
The giant's five years younger than me.
You think I'll ever get there?
Thanks, man.
Okay, man.
But what about how much taller he is than me?
I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now.
Who knows what science will come up with in the future... ...but what if I die an unsuccessful, regularsize man?
You've been in the bathroom for a halfhour.
I know!
Had the beef tips, huh?
This is the last call for flight 1066 to A thens.
Happy anniversary!
Happy anniversary, 10 months.
In the shower I was thinking about our first night in London.
Joey's grandmother's right there.
The one who speaks English?
The one who doesn't.
That was some hot love you gave me.
I'll get ready.
Wear those earrings I got you.
That's a great idea.
I was saving them for something special.
You've got to go home.
But I like it here.
Get the earrings you borrowed.
He wants me to wear them.
I think they're in my purse.
Go get dressed and I'll look for them.
I need those earrings you borrowed.
When you flirt with a guy, you think, "No big deal."
But he thinks, "Finally!
Somebody who wants to sleep with me."
Did you find it?
The earring, no.
But I found my sunglasses.
I've been looking for these since last summer.
Those are mine.
You borrowed them from me.
Okay.
Calm down.
Here they are.
What do we do?
I don't know.
I don't know!
We'll just have to tell Monica, that's all.
Oh, God!
She's gonna kill me.
I could tell her it was all my fault.
Oh, that'd be great.
Mon, could I talk to you?
Yeah.
What is it?
I lost one of your earrings.
I'm sorry.
I am so, so sorry.
All right, what can you do?
If you lost it, you lost it.
I'll replace it.
I promise.
I feel so terrible.
That's fine.
You didn't do it on purpose.
Look at you.
Come here.
You feel better?
Yeah.
You're the best.
Okay, wait a minute.
I can't do this.
Listen, honey, it's not Phoebe's fault.
She lent me the earrings.
I lost it.
I'm so sorry, honey.
I feel terrible too.
That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!
First, my jewelry.
If it's not that, it's my sweater.
And if it's not that, it's my sunglasses.
Your sunglasses?
...I'll shoot this duck!
Oh, no!
I'm coming out!
And she's supposed to buy this?
Ground control to Major Tom Commencing countdown Engines On That's scenes from next week's show.
Next week.
I am definitely gonna watch that.
Do these look the same?
Definitely.
Not as each other.
Then, no.
Hey, you ready?
Yeah.
You look amazing.
I'm the luckiest man in the world.
You're about to get a little luckier.
Let me see the earrings.
Right, the earrings.
They look great.
Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
My boyfriend really does have great taste.
Thanks for picking out the earrings
You are steel!
Let me ask you, how come when I call your computer support line...
...I have to wait an hour and a half?
We're adding operators all the time.
Could we concentrate on my training?
It's just hard when I know I have email I can't get.
Hi.
Monica.
Hi, honey.
On the table.
On the table, please.
So listen, my friends were telling me a little bit about... ...this Ultimate Fighting thing.
It sounds really dangerous.
I don't want you to get hurt because I kind of like you.
I don't want to get hurt either.
I'm being smart about this.
See these guys?
They're the best trainers in the world.
And Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin.
A house painter!
He used to be a house painter!
Promise me you'll be careful.
I promise.
Are we still on for tonight?
Good.
Because... ...maybe we could have a little workout of our own.
No boomboom before big fight!
I saved 30 cents.
Plus, I get to keep the cup.
From New York City, New York... ...appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut... ...he's known for his confrontational business style!
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing... ...Pete Becker!
I love you, Pete!
And his opponent, from Huntington Beach, California... ...he's a 300pound street fighter...
...Tank Abbott!
Pete?
Pete?
That guy's pretty huge.
Don't worry.
I'll use his strength and weight against him.
Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.
You go get him.
Let's go!
Here we go, gentlemen.
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
You are terrible at this, okay?
You are the worst ultimate fighter ever.
Ever!
I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm... ...and a severely bruised Adam's apple, but that really hurt.
Well, then, you know what?
I care about you too much to watch you hurt yourself like this.
So if you have to do this, you'll have to do it without me.
If you're asking me to quit... ...then you're asking me to be someone I'm not.
I've got to do this.
Then I've gotta go.
Bye.
Monica?
Yes?
Could you leave a note?
I'm on painkillers... ...and I might not remember this tomorrow.
Yes, I do.
Now, get on out of here, you!
Pete Becker circles the ring.
Looks like he's just trying to feel him out.
Bruiser is charging!
Run.
Run, you crazy, rich freak!
I can't watch this.
Check it out!
Pete's winning!
Really?
No!
Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favorite area!
Wait!
If that's his favorite area, why is he being so mean to it?
This is ironic.
Your last boyfriend, Richard, didn't want to have kids.
From the looks of it, now Pete can't
The One With Phoebe's Husband This is unbelievable, Pheebs.
How can you be married?
I'm not "married" married, you know?
He's just a friend, and he's gay... ...and he was from Canada, and he needed a Green Card.
I can't believe you married Duncan!
How could you not tell me?
We told each other everything.
I'm sorry, but I knew if I told you, you'd get judgmental... ...and wouldn't approve.
Of course I wouldn't approve!
You were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay.
What the hell were you thinking?
See?
And you thought she'd be judgmental.
I wasn't in love with him.
I was helping out a friend.
When he left town, you stayed in your pajamas for a month.
And I saw you eat a cheeseburger.
Well, didn't you?
I might have.
I can't believe you didn't tell me.
Like you tell me everything?
What have I not told you?
I don't know.
The fact that the underwear out on the telephone pole is yours... ...from when you had sex with Bobby on the terrace!
What?
Wait a minute!
Who told you?
You are dead meat.
I didn't know it was a big secret.
Oh, it's not big.
Not at all.
IKind of the same as, say...
...I don't know, having a third nipple!
You have a third nipple?
You bitch!
Whip it out!
Whip it out!
There's nothing to see!
It's a tiny bump.
It's totally useless.
As opposed to your other multifunctional nipples?
I can't believe you!
You told me it was a nubbin.
Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?
You see something, you hear a word, I thought that's what it was.
Let me see it again!
Yes, show us your nubbin!
Joey was in a porno movie!
If I'm going down, I'm taking everybody with me!
Oh, my God!
You were in a porno?!
I was young and I just wanted a job.
But I couldn't go through with it.
They let me be the guy who fixes the copier but can't... ...because there's people having sex on it.
That is wild!
What's it shaped like?
Is it hairy?
What happens if you flick it?
So does it do anything, you know, special?
Pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance... ...to the magical land of Narnia.
In some cultures, having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility.
You get the best huts, and women dance naked around you.
Are any of these cultures, per chance, in the TriState area?
You know, you are so amazing.
Is there anything you don't know?
Julie's so smart!
Julie's so special!
I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did.
But he's with her now.
You'll have to get over it.
Oh, I'm going to have to get over it.
I didn't know that's what I had to do.
I just have to get over it.
Sassy lady!
Where are you going?
I'm meeting Duncan.
He's skating tonight at the Garden.
He's in the Capades.
The Ice Capades?
No, the Gravel Capades.
The turns aren't as fast, but when Snoopy falls?
Funny.
I can't believe you'd dress up for him.
You're setting yourself up all over again.
Okay, no.
For your information, I'm seeing him so I can put those feelings behind me.
The reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice... ...to look nice for your gay husband.
Darn it, we're all out of milk.
Chandler, will you fill me up here?
I see, I see.
Because of the thirdnipple thing.
You came to see me yesterday.
I mean, it's just.. That dress..   Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good.
They're good.
It's just been a while since I've seen you like this.
You clean up good.
Really?
Well, thank you.
Okay, stop looking at me like that.
Last time that happened, that happened.
Right, right.
So are you excited about your first night away from Emma?
Yeah, yeah.
Phoebe and l are gonna have so much fun.
Thank you for watching the baby.
It's fine.
Actually, I invited Mike over.
Phoebe's Mike?
Yeah.
I didn't know you hung out.
We don't..   but I'd like to get to know him.
Maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.
That's so cute.
Ross and Mike's first date.
It's not a date.
But if it turns out to be something more..
Will that be awkward?
What are you gonna talk about?
I don't know.
But you know, we have a lot in common, you know?
He plays piano.
I played keyboards in college.
He's been divorced.
I have some experience in that area.
Yeah?
Hi!
Girl's night out indeed.
So I think Emma is probably down for the night..    but if you need anything..  We'll be fine.
You go have fun.
Okay, you too.
Thanks.
And I hope you score.
Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?
I mean, they said 30 minutes or less.
Well, how long has it been?
Eleven minutes.
And now 12.
So you wanna watch TV?
You think I haven't thought of that?
So you like the beer?
I do.
I do.
Although, it's actually a lager.
What's the difference between beer and lager?
I don't know.
We could look it up.
Things are about to get wild.
Oh, God, remember the girls' nights we used to have..   sitting around talking about you and Ross?
So, what's going on with you and Ross?
Well, I don't know.
I mean, for a long time, nothing.
But you know, actually, right before you picked me up..   Ross and I had a little thing.
Oh, my God!
I love things!
What happened?
Well, first he told me he liked how I looked.
And then we had a little..   eye contact.
Eye contact?
I hope you were using protection.
Excuse me, these are from the two gentlemen at the end of the bar.
Oh, actually, I can't have another one on account of my breast milk.
Should we send them something back?
Let's send them mashed potatoes!
No, wait!
Don't do that!
That'll make them think they can come over.
So, what if they do?
We're not here to meet guys.
You have a boyfriend.
I have a baby and a Ross.
Yeah, but nothing has to happen.
We're just having fun.
You know, not everything has to go as far as eye contact.
The point is maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments with Ross.
You know?
I should just move on with my life.
So really, you're moving on from Ross?
I don't know.
Do I have to decide right now?
You kind of just did.
That guy is gonna call you tonight.
Ross will pick up the phone, and that's a pretty clear message.
Oh, my God, Ross!
Ross is gonna pick up the phone.
I have to get my number back.
Oh, my God, he's gone!
"Oh, I have to get my number back!
Oh, my God!
He's gone!"
Dead on.
So, Rachel, what are you doing tonight?
Big glamour night.
Me and Monica at Launderama.
You wanna hear a freakish coincidence?
Guess who's doing laundry there too?
Who?
Me!
Was that not clear?
Why don't.
Why don't I just join you both there?
Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
I do have a laundry room in my building.
But there's a rat problem.
Apparently, they're attracted to the dryer sheets.
They're going in fine, but they're coming out all fluffy.
Anyway, 7ish?
It's just gonna be me and Rachel.
Hold on there, camper.
You've thought this through?
It's laundry.
The thinking through is pretty minimal.
Just you and Rachel?
Just the two of you?
This is a date.
You're going on a date.
What are you saying?
I should shave again?
Pick up some wine?
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear.
It's the first time she'll see your underwear.
You want it to be dirty?
And the fabric softener?
Now, what is wrong with my Snuggles?
What?
It says I'm a sensitive, warm kind of guy.
You know, like a little fuzzy bear.
I can pick something else up on the way.
What did you get me there?
Hey / Hi  So did you, uh, did you tell Ross?
Well, I tried  but then he had a shampoo related emergency.
Huh, so I guess now it's your turn again.
No, no, no,....I think it's better  if you tell him.
You know?
And it's easier for a woman.
That way,  you know, if he gets mad,  all you have to do is go  "I didn't mean it."
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, cause that's what we do.
Alright, alright, okay, um,  how about this?
How about this?
Tomorrow,  tomorrow we both go and will tell him together.
Okay, that sounds fair.
That just means, once again, we can't ...
I know, I know.
That's okay.
I mean we can control ourselves.
We're not animals.
/ No!
Of course we can wait.
Alright, so I guess that means good night, then.
Yup.
Good night.
Good~ night.
Good night.
Seriously, good night.
Stop saying good night.
Okay!
I'm so sorry.
I just don't get why you like it so much.
Yes!
We got a baby boy!
Frank Junior, Junior!
How does he look?
So gross!
Okay.
You ready to push again?
Little Leslie's here!
We got another one!
Oh, my God!
I can't believe I have two children.
How scary is that?
Come on, little Chandler, it's time to be born.
Oh, God!
Kindergarten flashback.
They read the sonogram wrong, because they thought it was a boy.
But Chandler's a girl!
Okay, keep saying it.
Oh, my God!
You did it, man.
Would you like to see them?
They're so small.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Great.
Are you really going to date that nurse man?
You and I are just "goofing around."
I thought, why not "goof around" with him?
I don't know if you've looked up "goofing around" in the dictionary.
Well, I have... ...and the technical definition is: Two friends who care a lot about each other... ...and have amazing sex... ...and just want to spend more time together.
But if you have this new dictionary that gets you mad at me... ...then we have to get you my original one.
I am so bad at this.
You're better than you think you are.
Really?
Okay.
So if?
Know when to stop.
I sensed that I should stop.
So we're okay?
I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen.
Don't do the dance.
Right.
You're my favorite.
Which one do you have?
I don't care.
Frank and Alice want me to tell you they're making phone calls.
Did you talk to them about, you know... No, honey.
It was a long shot.
You guys?
Can I just have a second alone with the babies?
So here you are.
Seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that petri dish.
Everyone said labor was the hardest thing.
But they were wrong.
This is.
Well, I had the most fun with you guys.
I wish I could take you home and see you every day.
I'll settle for being your favorite aunt.
I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me.
Okay, so we're cool.
We're gonna be great.
Little highfives.
Well, if you're going to cry... Phoebe, we are so proud of you.
Maybe they can girlie it up a bit, like Chandlerette.
Alice called her Channyfanny.
Haha, Channyfanny

What are you doing tomorrow night?
Oh, well, let me see.
I believe I'm..
Yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.
Well, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.
I could fall asleep at a play.
What is it?
It's a onewoman play called:   Why Don't You Like Me?
A Bitter Woman's Journey Through Life.
That sounds interesting.
That does sound interesting.
To listen to a woman complain for two hours.
I don't think it gets bet..
I know!
I know.
We can drive.
We can vote.
We can work.
What more do these broads want?
Well, you guys will have a great time.
I promise.
What?
How come you don't have to go?
I wish I could, but I found out..   that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go.
But take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.
Let's see.
Who do I hate?
Oh, sorry.
Oops, sorry.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Up we go.
Oh, gosh, okay!
All right.
Can I ask you a question?
Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around..   and not have it be a big deal?
No, I don't think that ever works.
Why?
No reason.
No, no.
Rachel?
Who do you want to fool around with?
Nobody!
Forget it.
Joey?
Maybe.
You can't.
Why?
Because!
Okay, seriously, did not understand a word you just said.
In the hall.
Okay.
You wanna fool around with Joey?
Yeah.
Ever since I had that dream about him, I can't get it out of my head.
I mean, what's the big deal?
People do it all the time.
Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
Okay.
Off the top of my head.. Don and Janet.
Who are they?
I know them from work.
Both of them?
No, just one of them.
Which one?
I don't know.
What were the names I just said?
No, Rachel, things could get incredibly complicated.
All right.
You're right.
I won't do anything with Joey.
I just thought it..
Okay, so that's two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and a red onion?
What the hell are you cooking?
You guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.
Hi, Joey, it's Jan Rogers.
Can 't wait for your party tonight.
Listen, I forgot your address.
Can you give me a call?
Thanks.
Bye.
What's happening?
It's a real shame you can't make it to that onewoman show tonight.
I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day.
You know me, work comes first.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hi, Joey, it's Jan Rogers.
Can 't wait for your party tonight.
Stupid Jan Rogers!
You are having a party tonight?
I'm kind of having a thing for the Days of Our Lives people.
And you weren't gonna tell us?
How did you think you were gonna get away with that?
I do it every year.
You do that every year?!
I didn't have to tell you that!
God, I'm stupider than Jan Rogers!
That's why you got us tickets to that play, to get rid of us!
Yeah.
Last year is that why you sent us to that Medieval Times restaurant?
Yeah.
And the year before that, you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?
I can't believe you guys went for that one.
Why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?
You're fine, okay?
But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people.
Well, then, so just invite me.
Please, I was trying to be nice.
You're the worst one.
Joey, come on!
Please, please?
Let me come.
I will behave.
I promise.
I will behave.
Please, please, please.
Okay, fine.
You can come.
But don't tell anybody else.
It's up on the roof at 8.
Yeah.
You were supposed to divert her, not date her.
Can you give me a second while I talk to this woman... ...who, by the way, did not spend the night?
Sure.
Okay.
I did divert her, and we ended up having a great time, okay?
Watching ballroom dancing?
Yes, that's where we realized we were both supercool people.
Look, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
Like what?
Like she's really mean... ...and she's overly critical and... She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you.
Okay.
And she uses sex as a weapon.
Thank you for warning me.
At breakfast, I'll be on alert for room painting and sex weapons.
You're still gonna go out with her?
Yeah.
Well, didn't you hear what I just said?
Pheebs, come on.
I mean, consider the source.
Of course her exhusband's gonna say that stuff.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Listen to me, she is crazy!
Your door isn't soundproof.
You see?
Nothing is good enough for her.
How are things going with Crazy?
Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
Listen, you are hearing one side of the story.
Okay?
FYI, she must have shown Kyle over 30 paint samples... ...before she painted that room.
And his response to each one was, "I don't give a tiny rat's ass."
Maybe she should have spent a little less time decorating... ...and a little more time in the bedroom.
I don't think we are going to have that problem... ...but maybe that's just because I am not emotionally unavailable.
You think he's emotionally unavailable?
I think he can be.
Maybe he wouldn't be... ...if she didn't bring the office home every night.
Excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life.
Well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve, 1997.
I knew you were going to throw that in my face!
That was three years ago.
She apologized and apologized.
What more do you want?
We want the last six years back!
So do we!
So do we!
I'm sorry you had to see that.
My God!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is that annoying?
And speaking of being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
Maybe she wouldn't have to be selfish in bed... ...if someone else knew where everything was.
Oh, he knows.
For the most part.
Oh, hey.
Good, you're both here.
We kind of need to talk.
Both of you, together?
What's up?
Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things... ...and we got to reminiscing.
We talked most of the night... ...and realized the reason we're angry with each other... ...is because there are still feelings there.
So... Oh, just say it, Kyle!
We're gonna try again.
What about her whining, and her constant need for attention?
I'm gonna work on that.
Right, because you're so capable of change.
You know, he hums when he pees.
I do know.
Makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
We're so sorry.
That's all right.
We don't need you.
I'm over it already.
Yeah, and I don't even give a tiny rat's ass.
Yeah, we're gonna go.
I'm sorry.
Pheebs, you were right about her.
You know, she did try to use sex as a weapon.
Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
You know, he hums while he does other stuff too.
We're better off without them.
Even if they break up again, you better not let him in your sad men's club.
Divorced men's club.
Potayto, potahto.
Why couldn't they have sent me to Texas?
Seven o'clock.
Maybe I'll hit the gym.
Who am I kidding?
Payperview porn.
Do not disturb!
Do not disturb!
Surprise!
Monica?
Is everything all right?
Yeah, everything's great.
I was just..   watching some regular television there.
What a pleasant surprise.
I'm gonna go freshen up, okay?
Okay, honey.
That was close.
Hello.
Hey, Rach, it's me.
Okay, I just got to Chandler's room, and I caught him..   molesting himself.
That couldn't have been pretty.
But you know, guys do that.
Well, the weird part is..   he was getting off.. to a sharkattack show!
No!
Yes!
Chandler watches shark porn!
While watching sharks?
Yeah.
Are you sure that's what he was doing?
You know how many times I've seen him jump up like that?
Believe me, I know what he was doing.
Man!
Sharks!
I always knew there was something weird about that dude.
You promised to love him no matter what.
"What" means, like, if he gets a disease or kills someone.
Not if he gets his jollies to Jaws.
You know what, honey?
Guys are just different.
They like things that we can't understand.
I once dated this guy who wanted to pretend..   that he was an archeologist, and I was this..   naughty cavewoman who he unfroze from a block of ice.
Are you talking about my brother?
I didn't disguise that very well, did I?
How was your flight?
It was great.
I ordered a pool float from the Sky Mall.
Why don't you sit down.
Get yourself comfortable.
Because I have a little..   surprise for you.
Well, well, well.
It must be 5:00 in Tulsa..   because it's "sex o'clock" in N.Y.C.!
Okay.
This is how much I love you.
The great white..   Honey?
Why am I watching a bunch of sharks swimming around?
Is this..?
Is this not the good part?
Do you want me to fastforward to something.. toothier?
No, I'm just not sure that you got the right movie, that's all.
This is the only one they had at our video store.
Though they did have something called Crocodile Killers.
Or does it always have to be sharks?
Does what always have to be sharks?
Look, we can do something else.
Do you want me to get into the tub and.. thrash?
What's going on?
It's okay.
It's okay.
I still love you.
Let me be a part of this.
Let me be a part of this!
I saw what you were doing in Tulsa.
Angry sharks turn you on!
No, they don't.
Then why were you watching them and giving yourself a treat?
Oh, my God!
When you came in, I switched the channel.
I was just watching regular porn.
Really?
Yes.
Just some good, oldfashioned, American, girlongirl action.
Can I tell you how happy that makes me?
You are an amazing wife.
Really, you are amazing.
You were actually gonna do this for me?
Where do you find the strength and the understanding for that?
I'm very, very drunk right now.
You're in your 30s and you have never been in a longterm relationship.
Oh, my God!
It's her.
It's that Victoria Secret model.
Something Goodacre.
Hi, Mom, it's Jill.
She's right.
It's Jill.
Jill Goodacre.
Oh, my God!
I am trapped in an A TM vestibule with Jill Goodacre.
Maybe it's an atrium?
Yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot.
I'm fine.
I'm just stuck at the bank in an ATM vestibule.
Jill says vestibule, I'm going with vestibule.
I'm fine.
No, I'm not alone.
I don't know, some guy.
Oh, some guy.
I am some guy.
Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night.
Yes, he was some guy.
Hey, everyone.
All right, all right!
It's been 14 1/2 minutes and you still haven 't said one word.
Oh, God!
Do something!
Just make contact.
Smile!
There you go.
You're definitely scaring her.
Would you like to call somebody?
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with.
Yeah, thanks.
It's me.
What's up, man?
I'm stuck in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!
Oh, my God!
He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!
Chandler, listen.
Like that thought never entered my mind.
On second thought, gum would be perfection.
Gum would be perfection?
Gum would be perfection.
Could've said, "Gum would be nice. "
"I'll have a stick. "
But, no.
For me, gum is perfection.
I loathe myself!
Oh, no, the Mellons.
Okay.
What next?
Blow a bubble.
A bubble's good.
It's got a boyish charm.
It's impish.
Here we go.
Nice going, imp!
It's okay.
All I need to do is reach over and put it back in my mouth.
Good save!
We're back on track and I'm chewing someone else's gum.
This is not my gum!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
And now you're choking.
You all right?
Oh, my God!
You're choking!
Better?
Thank you.
That was.
That was.
Perfection?
Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this.
Watch, it's easy.
Ready?
Now try it.
You gotta whip it.
This has been fun.
Yes.
Thanks for letting me use your phone and for saving my life.
Well, goodbye, Chandler.
I had a great blackout.
See you.
I'm account number 7143457.
Hey, where is this guy?
It's been over an hour.
Well, he's coming from Jersey.
He said he would get here as fast as he could.
Who is it?
It's the police.
Whoo, that' a lot of stairs.
Hoo, boy.
You should warn people there's no elevator.
Whoa, oh...
I should not have had that Mexican food for lunch.
Areare you gonna be okay, officer, uh...  goodbody.
If you say so.
So, where's the young lady who I am supposed to take... downtown?
Oh, god.
All right, somebody show me where to plug in my box,  and we'll get this party started.
Wah!
Where?
Okay, okay, ladies, can I have your attention, please?
Did someone call for the long arm of the law?
I should warn you, I have a concealed weapon.
I hope you're familiar with this state'S... penal code.
Okay, okay, enough teasin'.
Now for some pleasin'.
She cringed!
This is how I look when I'm turned on.
You were talking about me before.
Look, I don't need this.
I'm out of here.
Where's my hat?
Look, I've been in this business for a long time.
Shocking.
Now if you'll just pay me my $300, I'll be on my way.
Yeah, ye ... this is so weird.
You never know when it's going to be your last dance.
And I didn't even get a chance to finish it.
Finish it.
What?
Your last dance.
Do it for us.
Really?
Really?
He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time.
Okay.
All right  Get ready, ladies.
It's only for second, but it was amzaing.

Broke up with her.
Oh, why?
Don't tell me.
Because of the big nostril thing?
They were huge!
When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
They were not that huge.
I'm telling you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
How many women will you reject... ...over superficial, insignificant things Hold it.
I gotta side with Chandler on this one.
When I first moved here, I went out with this girl.
Really hot.
Great kisser... ...but she had the biggest Adam's apple.
Drove me nuts.
You or me?
I got it.
Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
You guys are messing with me, right?
Yeah.
We are!
That's a good one.
For a second there, I was like, whoa!
The One Where Heckles Dies You name one woman that you broke up with for an actual real reason.
Maureen Rasillo.
Because she doesn't hate Yanni is not a real reason.
Hello, Mr. Heckles.
You're doing it again.
We're not doing anything.
You're stomping.
It's disturbing my birds.
You don't have birds.
I could have birds.
We'll try to keep it down.
Thank you.
I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
All right, byebye.
Okay, Janice.
Give me Janice.
That wasn't about being picky.
We'll give you Janice.
I miss Janice, though.
Hello, Chandler Bing!
Oh, my God!
Oh, Chandler!
Now!
Now!
That's it.
There!
Faster!
Stop with the broom!
We're not making noise!
We won.
We did it!
Mr. Heckles!
How did this happen?
He was sweeping.
They found a broom in his hand.
That's terrible.
I know.
I was sweeping yesterday.
It could've been me.
Sweeping.
You never know.
Never know.
I just don't want to be alone tonight.
Okay, well, um...
I can maybe grab a sleeping bag or... oh... oh.
No, Rach!
I'm sorry, I just...
I just don't think this...  this is a good idea.
Well, we won't know that until we do it, will we?
Uh, look, um, you are upset about your father  and you're feeling vulnerable.
And I just don't feel it would be right.
I feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.
Taking advantage?
I'm giving you the advantage.
Enjoy.
Look, I'm sure it would be great.
But I think one of us has to be thinking clearly.
So I'm going to go.
Wow.
Okay.
I'll see you in the morning.
Haven't had sex in four months.
I should get a medal for that.
Thanks so much for taking me to all those places.
You've been quiet all morning.
Is everything okay?
Mmhmm.
You sure you're all right?
Yep.
OKy.
Um, well, I'm going to go grab us some breakfast.
FYI... (For Your Information)  There it is.
In the future, when a girl asks for some illadvised sympathy sex,  just do it.
Wait, wait.
You're mad at me about last night?
I was just trying to do the right thing.
Really?
Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing,  I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed.
I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied.
Well...  oh, stop that!
I can't believe this.
What do you...
I...
I was just being a good guy.
I treated you with respect and understanding.
Oh, that's so hot.
Hey, I was looking out for you!
Oh, really?
Well, Ross, you know what?
I am a big girl.
I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.
I got to say I've not had sex a lot of times before.
This is the worst ever.
Oh, really?
Really?
Well, it wasn't very good for me, either.
Oh, okay.
Hey, hey, you know what?
You know what?
To avoid this little thing in the future,  let's just sayyou and me?
Never having sex again.
What?
That's right.
Sex is off the table.
I am never having sex with you again.
Dr. Green, are you feeling better?
And also, you know, I, uh,  I was thinking about what you said, you know,  about the whole sex thing, and...  probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
Thank you.
I'm glad, I'm glad you agree.
It's a shame, though.
I mean, when we did it,  it was pretty good.
Yeah, yeah, that's true.
Hey, do you remember that one really great time?
Oh, yeah.
You know, it was your birthday.
/ Valentine's day.
Oh, yeah.
Well, I guess that's all in the past now.
Hmmmmmmm.
Not even one more time?
Not even once.
No matter how much we want it.
Even if we want it really bad.
That's what we decided.
Uhm, right!
It's kinda hard though!
Yeah.
You know, when two people have a connection, you know,  that's... just seems like such a... waste.
...I hate waste.
Ross?
Yes?
Just so you know...   With us...    it's never off the table.
Damn it.
It's never off the table.
Okay, can you really tapdance?
Okay, you time me.
Ready?
Ready...   GO!
You did it
What are you guys doing?
Try it, I can't feel a thing!
Are, are you kidding?
This is packing?
We're taking a break!
From?
Jumping on the bed?
All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do.
Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!
You got it!
All right, she's right, we gotta get serious.
Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
No, no, no, guys.
She's right.
We should get to work.
I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you repack whatever Joey packs.
You guys hear a ringing?
What the hell is this?
Hey./ Hey.
Hey, where's Rach?
Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.
Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional  so no one say anything to set her off, ok?
Hey Rach, hey you./ Here she is!
Hi you guys!
What did I just say?
No, no, no.
It's ok.
I'm gonna be fine.
Come here, I'll make you a drink.
Oh, man!
I can't believe she's actually leaving.
How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
I know, she's been such a big part of my life.
And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled.
I mean... oh, forget it.
I miss Melrose Place!
You know, I had a chance to stop her too!
Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row?
Head she wins, tails I lose.
Wait a minute...
Yes, Joe?
I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!
I was just in our bedroom and I found these on my pillow.
Oh, yes.
I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by  and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!
What are you talking about?
These aren't mine.
Oh yeah, right!
Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!
That would be a terrible punishment.
But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.
Really?
Then what are they doing in our guest room?
Rachel used to live in that room.
Rachel... with handcuffs!
Interesting!
Joey's bare ass!
I think I have something that belongs to you.
Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.
No, no, no...
They're really yours.
We... found them in your old room.
Well, these aren't mine.
Maybe Monica used to use them with...  Don't say Richard!
Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?
Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.
Pheebs!
/ Yeah!
I think these are yours.
These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on!
Good God!
You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these,  they'll snap like a piece of licorice.
Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
Sure.
You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
Where do you think Mike really is?
A little more.
Okay.
A little more, a little more.
A little more... All right.
Okay, all right, let's do this.
All right, ready?
Yeah.
All right, now give me your best shot.
All right, here it goes...
The Matador... Ole!
Sweetie, can you hold this for a second?
Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face.
But it's gone now.
You're all right.
Hi, everyone.
I wanted to thank you for our little talk before.
No problem!
So you're gonna go with the waiting thing?
I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
Good.
What did he say?
He told me to get over myself and just do it.
I thought about what you said and about what he said.
And his way, I get to have sex tonight, so... What is this in my pocket?
Why, it's Joey's porno movie!
Pop it in!
I'm fine, if you're okay watching a video... ...filled with twonippled people.
People having sex.
That's just what I need to see.
What's wrong with people having sex?
Well, you know, these movies are offensive... ...and degrading to women and females... And the lighting's always unflattering.
Monica, help me out here.
Hell, I wanna see Joey!
So is there a story?
Or do they just start doing it right Oh.
Never mind.
Wait a minute.
That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
All I say is, she'd better get the job.
Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
Here I come.
See, I'm coming to fix the copier.
I can't get to the copier.
I'm thinking, "What do I do?"
So I just watch them have sex.
Then I say Here's my line!
You know, that's bad for the paper tray.
Nice work, my friend!
Wait, you see me again.
Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.
There I am.
There I am.
There I am...
So you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets or...?
That's good.
So who broke up with who?
I broke up with her.
She actually thought Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
When everybody knows that the capital of Cambodia is...
It's not Sean Penn.
I got a funny one.
My last girlfriend, Tilly.
We're eating breakfast, right?
I made these pancakes.
Like, 50 pancakes.
All of a sudden, she turns to me and says, "Eddie...
...I don't wanna see you anymore."
It was literally like she had reached into my chest... ...ripped out my heart and smeared it all over my life!
There was this incredible abyss and I'm falling.
I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop!
That wasn't such a funny story.
And a crusty old man Said I'll do what I can And the rest of the rats Played maracas That's it!
I'm looking for Eddie Manoick.
He's not here right now.
I'm Chandler.
Can I take a message or... Or a fish tank?
Thanks.
Come on in.
I'm Tilly.
I gather by that "Oh," he told you about me.
Yeah, your name came up... ...in a conversation that terrified me to my very soul.
He's kind of intense.
Yes!
Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little... A little what?
...bit country?
You know, a little rock and roll.
Come on in, you roomie!
Hello, Tilly.
Eddie, I just came by to drop off your tank.
That was very thoughtful of you.
It's very thoughtful.
Well, okay then.
I'm gonna go.
Bye.
So we getting a fish?
You had sex with her.
I didn't sleep with your exgirlfriend.
That's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.
This is nuts!
Crazy!
She came over for two minutes... ...dropped off a fish tank and left!
Where's Buddy?
Buddy?
My fish, Buddy.
There was no fish when she dropped it off.
This is unbelievable!
You sleep with my exgirlfriend, insult my intelligence by lying... ...then you kill my fish?
My Buddy?
I didn't kill your fish!
Look, Eddie Would you look at what I'm doing?
Now that can't be smart.
So we're just gonna take this guy right off you... ...and put him here in Mr. Pocket.
Tangelo?
So when I woke up this morning... ...he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes!
Why?
He thinks I slept with his exgirlfriend and killed his fish.
Why would you kill his fish?
Because sometimes after you sleep with someone... ...you have to kill a fish.
Chandler, honey...
Pecan sandy?
Just made them.
Yeah, all right.
Are these raisins?
Sure, why not?
Listen, Eddie.
I've been thinking about our living situation.
Why are you smiling?
I got a little surprise.
Look.
There's a new fishy.
I named him... ...Chandler, you know, after you.
Well, that's not even a real fish.
No, that's a Goldfish cracker.
So what's your point, man?
Okay, good night.
You big freak of nature!
Brisk tonight.
This is my father, Paul Stevens.
Dad, this is Ross Geller.
It's great to meet you, Paul.
I prefer that Liz's boyfriends address me as Mr. Stevens.
Of course.
Mr. Stevens.
So, Ross... what's your problem?
Excuse me?
Why can't you get a girlfriend your own age?
It's funny...
It's not funny.
I don't like you going out with my daughter, Ross.
Okay, I can see that.
I think if you give me one chance, I can change your mind.
Okay.
What?
Okay.
I'll give you one chance to change my mind.
You've got one minute.
Daddy.
Fine.
Two minutes.
Go.
A minute and 50 seconds.
I want you to know, I've never done anything like this before.
I mean, I've been in relationships in general.
But I've never done it with a student.
I mean, not... Not "it."
We haven't done "it."
I mean, we've done stuff...
Okay.
A joke.
Lighten the mood.
Two guys go into a bar.
One of them is Irish.
I'm Irish.
And the Irish guy wins the joke.
Ross!
How crazy that we would run into you.
Oh, my God!
Thank you.
I'd like you to meet my friends.
This is Phoebe, Monica and Chandler.
Phoebe.
You're Elizabeth's dad?
I see where she gets her... rugged handsomeness.
Is there a Mrs. Stevens?
There's a Mr. Bing!
Unfortunately, Lizzie's mom passed away after she was born.
I raised her by myself.
I get that a lot.
Why don't we all take a seat?
I'll get us all some coffees.
Yeah, why don't you... Talk about whatever you want.
Whatever pops into your head.
It is strange seeing Ross here, this time of day... because usually he's at the children's hospital.
But not looking for dates.
Monica is Ross's sister.
He's a great brother!
I had a sister.
She passed away.
You don't have to do that every time.
But Ross is a great guy.
I was roommates with him in college.
Funny story...
Your roommate in college died, didn't he?
A part of him did, yes.
Here we are, Paul, Elizabeth.
I hope you guys are finding something to talk about.
Yes.
We were just..
Sorry I'm late.
But I am ready to talk you up.
When does Liz's father get here?
I'm already here.
Ross is so great!
Wow!
What are you doing here?
I've been on standby for a flight home for hours.
So no sign of Emily?
Not yet.
When do you have to leave?
This is the last call for flight 1066 to A thens.
The last call.
Pretty soon, I guess.
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.
How could she do this?
Am I a complete idiot for thinking she'd actually show up?
You're not an idiot, Ross.
You're a guy very much in love.
Same difference.
All passengers for flight 1066 to Athens should now be onboard.
I get it!
Well, that's that.
No, you know what?
I think you should go.
I think you should go... ...by yourself.
Get some distance.
Clear your head.
It would be really good.
I don't know.
Come on.
It would be really good for you.
I could do that.
I can't even believe her.
You know what?
I am going to go.
Good.
Why not?
Right?
Right.
Thanks.
I'll see you back at home.
If I ever get a flight out of here.
What?
Wait, what?
Why don't you come?
I mean, I have two tickets.
Why not?
Well, I don't know, Ross.
Really?
Yeah.
It'd be great.
I mean, you can... You can lay on the beach... ...and I can cry over my failed marriage.
You see how I make jokes?
Really.
I mean...
I could use a friend.
Oh, wow.
Maybe.
Yes, I can do that!
Cool.
All right, cool.
Okay, we're going to Greece.
I forgot my jacket!
Well, you tell them to wait.
Wait!
Wait!
I'll have a glass of Merlot... ...and he'll have a wine spritzer.
Look!
The airport's moving.
Are we moving?
Are we?
Why are we moving?
Does the captain know that we're moving?
Oh, my gosh
Everybody, this is Parker.Parker, this is..   No, don't tell me.
Let me guess:Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel..   and I'm sorry,Phoebe didn't mention you.
Chandler, I'm kidding!Already you're my favorite.
Tell me a little about yourselves.Actually, we should get going.
Classic Ross!
Rachel, look how you glow!
May I?
I think you already are.
Rachel, you have lifegrowing inside you.
Is there anything more miraculous..A picture of a dog!
Whose is this?
What a beautiful place.What a great night.
I have to tell you, being herewith all of you in Event Room C..
I feel so lucky.
Think of the goodtimes that happened here.
The birthdays, the proms,the mitzvahs, both bar and bat!
None will compare with tonight.I don't want to forget it.
It's like I want to take a mentalpicture of you all.
Click.
I don't think the flash went off.
I'm gonna find the men's room.I'll go with you.
Somewhere there is someonewith a tranquilizer gun..   and a huge butterfly net lookingfor that man.
I have to go too, but I don'twant him complimenting my thing.
Glad we weren't in the car.Did he let up?
He called the Long lslandExpressway a "concrete miracle."
This room.
This night.
That waiter!
His shoes!I must take a mental picture!
Sorry.
Were you guys making fun of Parker?
That depends, how much did you hear?
He's a little enthusiastic.What's wrong with that?
It's so much.Well, so what?
I like him.
Do I make fun of the people you date?Tag, Janice, Mona.
No, because friends don't do that.Do you want my opinion?
Your collective dating record readslike a who's who of human crap!
I just wish Nana were aliveto hear Ross' toast.
My God, what a fantasticallywelllit hallway.
Can I get you something to drink,like a water and Valium?
I must say, this apartment,it's.. there are no words.
Thank God.It's a haven.
A thirdfloor paradise, a modern Eden.Yeah, I know, I know.
Gotcha.
Listen, why don't we just sit andrelax, just be with each other quietly.
That sounds great.
This is the most comfortable couchI've ever sat on.
Let's try something.Let's play a game.
I love games.Shocking.
Let's play the game of..   who can stay quiet the longest.
Or Jenga.
Let's play this one first, andremember, whoever talks first loses.
I lose, now Jenga.Oh, my God.
Is something wrong?You know the word "wrong"?
Everything isn't perfect or magical?
Everything isn't aglowwith the light of fairies?
They were just brake lights, Parker!
Excuse me for putting a good spinon a traffic jam.
You don't have to puta good spin on everything!
I'm sorry.
I'm a positive person.No, I'm a positive person.
You are like Santa Claus on Prozac.
At Disneyland, getting laid!
You want me to be negative?You want me to be less happy?
Much less happy.
Fine.
Well, then to quote Ross,"I better be going."
So long!
Don't let the "best door in the world"hit you in the ass on your way out.
Isn't this the most incredible fightyou've had in your life?
Oh, good God, Ross,how the hell do you do it

Okay.
And your horoscope says: "On the 5th, a special someone will give you a gift."
Well, thank you in advance.
"But the 12th brings a lover's spat."
You're going to make fun of my present.
Why would you do that?
Wait.
"On the 19th, a secret crush announces itself."
Hey, guys.
Hey.
It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
That's right.
It's your first day.
Are you psyched to fight crime with your robot sidekick?
Am I?
The lead in my own TV series?
I've dreamed about this for years!
Why have I not been preparing?
You're gonna be great.
But I gotta act with a robot.
I know nothing about technology.
I can't even use Chandler's computer, except to find porn.
And that's only because it's there when you turn it on.
Our spat will start early this month.
I'll be waiting.
The One Where Ross Meets Elizabeth's Dad Are you judging them by their covers?
You're really not supposed to.
I'm deciding which one to use.
I'm going to write another book.
Because the last one was such a big seller?
If you must know, I have written 14 books.
And as I'm the only one who has read them...
I can tell you that they have been well received.
But I lost all of them in the fire.
What are you doing later?
Rachel and I have to get our hair cut.
We do?
I wanna see what he wants.
Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
Wait a minute.
Hold the phone.
You're not Elizabeth's dad?
And that's yours.
Come on.
I really want this guy to like me.
It would really help if you guys could make me look good.
Of course we'll help.
Thanks.
We know how tough those parentteacher conferences can be.
I'm up to page 47.
Wow!
What are you writing?
Page numbers.
Honey, you got the kind with the little girl.
You said you'd buy the kind with the baby.
You said the baby creeps you out.
Why would the little girl creep you out?
Can you please talk a little slower?
This is for your book?
It's about relationships.
The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do.
Keep going.
This stuff's great.
Excuse me.
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.
And how people will believe anything as long as it's a compliment.
Oh, hi!
I got some saved for you, Phoebe.
Do you think Joey is more charming than me?
Yeah.
That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
You wish.
"You wish."
Stop writing about us.
I'm not writing about you.
I'm writing about other people.
Who?
Marsha and Chester.
Fine.
Then you know what?
I will just write about Phyllis.
"Phyllis is sitting in the chair."
I see what you're doing.
"Phyllis sees what I'm doing."
I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
Morning!
How's my favorite genius and his robot?
Oh, my good God!
I know what time you said.
What?
Well, I know what time Chester and Marsha said.
What time?
Interesting turn of events.
Suddenly it's my book to the rescue.
Let's see.
Very interesting.
Well this certainly clears things up.
What does it say?
I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
Thank you for writing your book.
It's a great book... and you are the queen of everything.
Thanks.
So are you.
I told you I should not wear this color.
"Monica.. Marsha and Chester are planning on seeing a movie Sunday.
"Marsha thinks they're meeting at 6:00.
Chester thinks it's 7:00."
You knew we were gonna miss the movie?
Right.
Instead of telling us, you decided to write it in your stupid book?
"Marsha and Chester are mad at Phyllis."
Googlie Worm.
The One with Joey's Dirty Day These will match the jacket you picked out last week?
There we go.
There it is.
You know what I need?
Gloves.
Brown leather dress gloves.
Well, let's see...
This one is large.
And this one... Also large?
Two larges coming right up.
Hello.
Damn you.
Could I have a moment?
My niece, you see, is in town from London.
Shropshire, but you know.
She's about your age, I'd say.
Anyway, I have tickets for the opera.
Die Fledermaus.
Would you like to keep her company tonight?
Sure.
You got it!
Count me in.
Me.
Fledermaus.
Great!
Yes, of course.
Thank you so very much.
So?
Gloves?
Sorry, I'll be right back.
Actually, I got to take off.
I was curious.
Do you have plans tonight?
No, nothing!
I invested in a nightclub.
It opens tonight.
Want to come?
That would be great!
You're into hardcore S & M, right?
Well, I guess.
I'm kidding.
I'll put you on the VIP list.
Look for me.
Great!
You bet.
I'll see you tonight.
I almost forgot the tickets.
What?
For you and Emily.
Tonight.
Die Fledermaus.
Oh, right.
You'll like it.
It has two out of the three tenors.
What's the matter?
Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight.
But I already told Mr. Waltham... ...that I would take his niece to the dumb old opera.
So, what are you going to do?
I don't know.
No!
Help me!
I can't.
I have to work.
Phoebe?
I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
Unless she wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
You guys, come on!
I have to meet Joshua.
It's my one chance for him to see the "fun" Rachel.
The "wouldn't it be great if she were my wife?"
Rachel.
Are Joey and Chandler back?
Chandler's still in phase one, and Joey's that thing you smell.
So... No.
Come on!
She's here.
Wait, wait.
Ross, please?
You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera... ...so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy?
That is a toughie.
She's looking down the hall.
She looked right at me.
You can't see people through that hole, can you?
I'll be right there!
Okay, Ross, please.
I thought we had moved on.
I thought we could be happy for each other.
I mean, was that just me?
All right, I'll do it.
Thank you, thank you.
Emily.
I'm Rachel Greene.
Thank goodness!
There's been a teeny change of plans.
I'm not free tonight Really?
I must've missed your call, though I didn't leave the flat all day.
Well, I That's not rude.
It's in keeping with the trip... ...where I've been run down by one of your wiener carts... ...and been stripsearched at the airport.
Apparently, I look like someone who's got cocaine stuffed up their bum.
I think you look great.
Good night.
It was very nice to meet you.
I'll get her.
Please, hurry.
Don't you just love the way they talk?
Okay, she's kicking.
She's growing inside you.
That was a big one.That's the youngest girl to reject me.
You guys!Hey there.
Let me ask you.Do you believe in soul mates?
Oh, yes, I do.
There's one person out therefor everyone.
You know how you find him?Stop looking.
I've stopped lookingfor Russell Crowe.
He'll find me.
And you?
No.
I believe that certain peopleare more suited for each other, but..
Soul mates?
I don't think they exist.Good.
Why?Well, last night, I met Monica's.
What?
I had a date with this guy.I swear he's her other half.
You don't think there's somebodybetter suited for Monica than me?
Well, what's he like?
He's tall.
He has brown hair.Of course.
A tall guy with hair similar to mine?Oh, unknowable universe!
He works with food.Oh, sure.
Older?
Obviously.
And he's British.I was just gonna ask!
And he's so centered,and mature and confident.
It's so sad they never met.
Luckily, the guy she settled forcan't hear you.
Oh, I'm so sorry.Maybe I'm wrong.
We're going out again.I'll find out more.
He's meant for her,and you're gonna date him?
He may not be my soul mate,but a girl's gotta eat.
Rachel?!
I didn't know Joey was on JAG.
Hey.Hey.
I talked to Joey.I wanted to see you.
I still can't believe it.Joey and Rachel?
Chandler, Monica, this is Don.Hello.
Hello, nice to meet you.How are you?
Soul mate.
What are you guys doing?We had lunch at Adriatica.
What's with the sundried tomatoes?I know!
Is this 1985?
That's what I said!
Isn't it strange?Not really.
What's wrong with sundried tomatoes?
On a barbecuedchicken pizza?
No?
What restaurants do you like?Octavio.
27and7.
There's this place, Alessandro's.Oh, my God!

I want to talk about your menu.Anyone want coffee?
If you're talking about me,I'll go with you.
I'll have a mochaccino.
What are you doing?
I swear, I didn't know you guyswould be here.
You don't believe in soul mates, so..
I believe in handsome strangerswho hit on my wife.
Just because I think they're soul matesdoesn't mean anything'll happen.
Phoebe?
Good work.
He's great.
I love him.
Don't worry, we'll find yousomeone else.
I'm phasing out the wine importingand focusing more on the cheese.
Cheese, you say?
That's somepretty smelly work, huh, Don?
Excuse me?Cheese.
It's smelly.
You must smell a lot of the time too.
Not really.
But with cheese,I think the smellier, the better.
Me too!
Chandler hates it.I can't have blue cheese in the house.
And you're still married to him?
I would like to go to France and eatnothing but bread and cheese.
Not even bread.
Just cheese.
No, I want the bread.
And pastries.
And pate.
I'm really not high.I just used to be fat.
I have a villa in the Loire Valleyyou can stay in.
Is it made of cheese?
No.
A house made of cheese,wouldn't that be incredible?
I'd move in tomorrow!Oh, come on!
Listen to this!I'm so sorry.
What do we do?They both want a house of cheese.
I don't know how you fight that.
That's good.
The audition's in a couple hours,and I don't understand the game.

Hey, they're running.
See, this is the brilliance of the show.
I say always keep them running.
All the time running!
Run!
Run, Yasmine!
Run like the wind!
But you wanted to live by yourself.
I did.
I thought it'd be great.
I figured I'd have time alone with my thoughts.
But it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you think.
Why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?
You really think he'd take me?
We had a good talk last night... ...but when I moved out, I hurt him bad.
He would definitely want you back.
I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.
But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night.
I mean, it was It was like when we first started living together.
I know you don't want to hear this right now... ...but we've seen him in his new place.
And he's happy.
He's decorated.
Chandler, he has moved on, okay?
You have to, too.
You'll have to accept the fact that you're just friends now.
You're not... ...roommates anymore.
Okay, Phoebe.
Smelly cat, smelly cat It's not your fault What's going on, man?
Eddie.
Morning.
I just came by to pick up my mail.
Where's the mail?
Over there on the table.
You don't keep it on this table anymore?
Eddie likes it over there.
All right, here you go, my friend.
Eggs a la Eddie.
That's great.
What?
I thought you liked your eggs... ...with the bread with the hole in the middle, a la me!
I do, but Eddie makes them this way.
They're pretty darn good.
Will you try some, there are some extra.
Well, you guys...
...I'm out of here.
See you, pals.
See you.
How are you two getting along?
I couldn't be happier.
Great.
I'm happy for you.
All right, that's it!
He just comes in here, Mr. Johnny New Eggs... ...with his moving the mail and his "See you, pals."
And now there's no juice!
There's no juice for the people who need the juice.

There's another carton there.
This isn't about juice anymore, all right, man?
All right.
So what's it about?
Eggs!
Whose eggs do you like better, his or mine?
Well, I like both eggs equally.
Oh, come on!
Nobody likes two eggs equally.
I wanna know which one you like better.
What's the difference?
Your eggs aren't here anymore.
You took your eggs and you left!
Did you expect me to never find new eggs?
You wanna play some foosball?

So, like, you guys all have jobs?
Yeah, we all have jobs.
That's how we buy stuff.
Yeah, I'm an actor.
Have I seen you in anything?
I doubt it.
Mostly regional work.
Unless you happen to catch the Wee One's production of Pinocchio at the Little Theater in the Park.
It was a job, all right?
"Look, Geppeto.
I'm a real live boy. "
I will not take this abuse.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
Once I was a wooden boy A little wooden boy You should both know that he's a dead man.
You got a job?
Are you kidding?
I'm trained for nothing.
I was laughed out of 12 interviews.
You're surprisingly upbeat.
You would be too if you found Joan and David boots on sale 50% percent off.
How well you know me.
They're my, "I don't need a job or my parents.
I've got great boots," boots.
How did you pay for them?
Credit card.
And who pays for that?
My father.
Come on, is this necessary?
You can't live off your parents.
I know that.
That's why I was getting married.
Give her a break.
It's hard being on your own for the first time.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
When I first came to this city, I was 1 4.
My mom had killed herself and my stepdad was in prison.
And I got here, and I didn't know anybody.
I ended up living with this albino guy who was cleaning windshields.
And then he killed himself.
Then I found aromatherapy.
Believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
The word you're looking for is: "Anyway.
.
.
. "
You ready?
No, I'm not ready.
Welcome to the real world!
It sucks.
You're gonna love it.
I can 't believe What I'm hearing What?

Hey, Rach!Hi.
Happy Valentine's Day!You too!
How's living at Ross'?
It's good, except he makes us watchthe Discovery Channel all day long.
Something really boring happenedto someone ugly in the Middle Ages.
Oh, thank you.I'll see you guys later.

I want a lot of things.
I wanna be with the woman I loveon Valentine's Day.

And I want relief from the wrenchingpain of knowing that won't happen!
We have red bagels.
Okay.
So how do you guyslike living together so far?
I know you're depressed,so I brought someone to cheer you up.
Right outside is a real,live, furry playmate.
I'm not sleepingwith your friend Jane again.
Hey, a dog!
Who, you gotta admit,looks a lot like Jane.
He's the happiest dog ever.I borrowed him from my friend Wendy.
So you can keep himtill he cheers you up.
I borrow him myselffrom time to time..   when I get depressedthinking about..   world hunger, poverty..   Not to trivialize your pain.
Thanks so much, Pheebs.We are gonna have so much fun!
Oh, not that kind of fun.
Get the ball!
You're cute, but you're not too smart.
Did I just throw this?
Hi.Hi.
I accidentally packed thesewith my stuff.
Who is this?Phoebe's friend's dog.
I don't know his real name.I call him Mozzarella.
You are so cute.
I wish I could play,but I've gotta go to work.
I hope I stop talking like thisbefore my meeting.
Yes, I do.
Byebye, Joey.Seriously, I can't stop it.
Come here!
Hey!
That's Rachel.
She used to live here.
Might as well be honest with you.We love her.
But we can't have her.
I really miss her.
Hey, you understand, right?You're a guy.
Well, you used to be.
So between her and me being friends,and her history with Ross..   it just isn't gonna happen.
It'd be like you falling in lovewith a cat.
Hey.Hey.
How's my favorite dog, huh?How's my favorite dog?
You're subdued.
Did you give him a beer?No.
Will you excuse us?
We need to talk.Sure.
Oh, me, right.
He's miserable.
What happened to him?Nothing.
We talked about stuff.What stuff?
Rachel stuff.

I'll take him to Wendy's.He's fine.
Look.

Now I'm all freaked out.Will you watch it with me?
Hey, so what is the big surprise?
Okay, okay, awkward question.
The hospital knows  you took two, right?
Yes, it's twins!
Oh, they're so cute!
Now,  what, what kinds are they?
This is a boy, and that's a girl.
Her name is Erica.
/Aw...   Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.
Yeah.
It's a shame you two didn't  get to spend more time together.
Yeah, we named the boy Jack  after dad.
Aw, he's gonna be so happy.
Oh, Jack Bing.
I love that.
Ooh, it sounds like a  '40s newspaper guy, you know?
"Jack Bing, Morning Gazette.
I'm gonna blow this story wide open!"
Oh my gosh.
Wow, so beautiful.
I want one.
Oh yeah?
Well, tell me which one,  and I'll try slip it in my coat.
Seriously.
Wanna make one of those?
One?
How about a whole bunch?
Really?
/  Yeah!
Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like  the Von Trapp family!
Only without the Nazis.
Although that sounds kinda dull.
Oh, you guys, I can't believe this.
But I'll leave now,  or I'm gonna miss my plane.
I'm just so glad you  got to see the babies.
Me too.
Oh, I'm just sorry  I'm not gonna be around to watch  you two attempt to handle this!
Alright, I can't say goodbye  to you guys again.
I love you all so much.
I love you./  I love you.
Call us when you get there.
I will.
Ross, come here.
I just want you to know..  Last night..
I'll never forget it.
Neither will I.   Alright, now I really have to go.
Okay.
Au revoir.
Oh, they're gonna really hate  me over there.
So, you just let her go?
Yeah.
Hey, maybe that's for the best.
Yeah?
Yeah.
You know?
You just...   Look, you gotta... You gotta think about  last night the way she does, okay?
Maybe,   maybe sleeping together was the  perfect way to say goodbye?
They slept together?
I was with you.
But now she'll never know how you feel!
Maybe that's okay.
You know?
Maybe, maybe it is better this way?
I mean, now, now you can move on.
I mean, you've been trying to  for so long,   maybe now that you're on  different continents..
Right?
/  Right.
Maybe now you can actually do it.
You know?
You can finally get over her.
Yeah, that's true.
Except  ...
I don't wanna get over her.
What?
/  I don't!
I wanna be with her.
Really?
Yeah, I'm gonna go after her.
Yeah, you are!
/ Woo!
Wait, wait!
Get your coat!
Get your coat!
My coat...
This is so cool!
I have no idea what's going on,  but I am excited!
But Ross, Ross.
What do you,  what do you think  she's going to say?
I don't know,    but I.. Look, even if she shoots   me down, at least I won't spend  the rest of my life wondering  what would have happened.
Where  where is my coat?!
You didn't bring one!
Hey, it's me.
Ironically, these guys were picked last in gym.
Hey, Pheebs.
You know what I'm thinking?
How... ...it's been so long since you've had sex... ...you're wondering if they've changed it?
No.
Although now that's what I'm thinking.
So what were you thinking?
You gave the guys great haircuts.
I thought you'd like to do mine.
No.
Why not?
Because I'm just...
I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
No, you're not.
I know I'm not, but you are.
I was trying to spare your feelings.
Hold on.
Ross, Julie for you.
Anybody know a good tailor?
You need clothes altered?
No, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
Go see Frankie.
My family's been going to him forever.
He did my first suit when I was 15.
No, wait, 16.
No, excuse me, 15.
All right, when was 1990?
You have to stop the QTip when there's resistance!
Sweetheart, I'll see you later.
Okay, bye.
That is so sweet.
Okay.
No, you hang up.
No, you One, two, three.
You didn't hang up either.
She didn't hang up.
No, you hang up.
You.
You.
Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
Rachel.
I'll just call her back.
Hi, sweetie.
I'm sorry.
We got disconnected.
No, you hang up.
How did this happen to me?
A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.
Ross was just Ross.
Just this guy.
Now all of a sudden, he's Ross... ...this really great guy that I can't have.
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
I know you did.
I'm just gonna deal with it.
I gotta get out of here!
I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
Okay, bye.
There's something important I have to tell you.
Are you pregnant?
No, but I'm throwing this shirt away.
I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
When I said that Chandler and I wanted to live together... we meant alone together.
Oh, my God.
That's funny.
I can't believe I did that.
No, sweetie.
You know what?
This is my fault.
I wasn't clear.
I'm really sorry.
Listen, you take as much time as you need to move out, okay?
There's absolutely no rush.
Okay.
Don't you want a cookie?
Sure.
Thanks.
Do you need a tissue?
Where did you get these?
I made them.
Oh, God, they're so yummy!
Oh, I guess it really is concentrated.
It's gonna be weird when I come home and you're not here.
No more Joey and Chan's.
No more J and C's.
Want to go to Joey and Chandler's?
Can't.
It's not there.
I'll be across the hall.
We can still do all the same stuff.
We won't be able to have those long talks at night... about our feelings and the future.
Not once did we do that.
I told Rachel that it's just gonna be the two of us.
Oh, yeah?
Well, how'd she take it?
Really well.
Surprisingly well.
She didn't cry.
She wasn't angry or sad.
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
All I'm asking for is a little emotion.
Is that too much to ask after six years?
What, are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?
I mean, did we not have as much fun?
Don't I deserve a few tears?
When we told Joey, he cried his eyes out.
I did not cry my eyes out!
Come on, it's like the end of an era.
No more JMan and Channy's!
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?
But still, it's a big change.
The end of an era, you might say.
Are you okay?
You're not blinking.
I'm fine.
I was thinking about how it's an end of an era.
Oh, all right.
But I gotta say, I don't think six years counts as an era.
An era is defined as a significant period of time.
It was significant for me.
Maybe it wasn't significant to you!
What is the matter with you?
What is the matter with you?!
Why aren't you more upset?
Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not living together?
Aren't you gonna miss me at all?
Monica, all right.
But don't get mad at me.
It's just a little hard to believe.
What's hard to believe?
I mean, it's you guys.
You do this kind of stuff, you know?
You were gonna get married in Vegas, and then you backed out.
I'm not upset because I don't see you going through with it.
I'm sorry.
It's going to happen.
Chandler will move in here.
But I..
I know, just let me finish, okay?
This isn't something that we just impulsively decided to do in Vegas.
This is something that we both really want.
And it is going to happen.
It is?
Really?
Yeah, sweetie.
You mean, we're not gonna live together anymore?
Oh, my God.
What about Ross?
Kip would've liked the birds.
Hi, Pheebs.
Are you moving out?
No, these aren't all of my suitcases.
This one's Paolo's.
Rachel, can we talk for a sec?
Sure.
Just for a sec, because Paolo's on his way over.
We haven't known each other for that long a time.
There are three things you should know about me.
One, my friends are the most important thing in my life.
Two, I never lie.
And three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
Thanks, Pheebs.
My God!
Why have I never tasted these before?
I don't make them a lot, because it's not fair to the other cookies.
You're right.
These are the best oatmeal raisin cookies.
Which proves that I never lie.
I guess you don't.
Paolo made a pass at me.
Are you okay?
I need some milk.
I've got milk.
Here you go.
Better?
I feel so stupid!
I think about the other day with you guys.
And I was all, "Oh, Paolo!
He's so great!
He makes me feel so."
God!
I'm so embarrassed!
I'm so embarrassed.
I'm the one he hit on.
Phoebe, I pushed him on you.
I'm so sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
Wait!
What are we sorry about?
I don't know.
Right.
He's the pig.
Such a pig!
Oh, God, he's such a pig!
He's like a big disgusting pig.
Pig man!
Yes, good!
But he was my pig man!
How did I not see this?
Oh, I know!
Because he's gorgeous.
And he's charming.
And the way he looks at you.
The end.
God!
Should I not have told you?
Trust me, it's much better that I know.
But I just liked it better before.
It was better.
Am I crazy, or does this totally go?
Oh, my God!
You look so beautiful!
Thank you, Rachel.
But look at Monica!
This is it.
Yeah, this is the one.
I can't believe I found it.
Wow, you look so beautiful.
If I knew you, I'd cry.
I'm Monica Geller.
Ball like a baby.
I know.
Can you hand me a tissue?
You're out of Diet Coke.
Hello?
What?
You what?
You listen here, missy!
That was Megan.
She booked The Swing Kings on the day of our wedding... ...and said I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!
Does that mean Carcass is available?
What am I gonna do?
That's the dress!
That is the dress!
Chandler wants the band.
What do I do?
Figure out a way to talk him out of it.
How?
You're out of toilet paper!
Joey got meat sauce on the banister again.
Swing music is so out.
He's gotta be in the room for that to work.
What are you guys talking about?
We're talking about The Swing Kings... ...and wondering whether they're the right way to go.
I went to a wedding once where they had swing music... ...and two months later, the couple divorced.
I'm not saying there's any connection here... ...but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.
But I love swing music!
But The Swing Kings?
They suck so much that people die at their concerts.
They just stop living.
All I know is that when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun.
And there's another reason.
Well, what is the other reason?
I don't want to say.
Well, you have to because maybe it's stupid.
It's just, while Monica and I were dancing to them... ...it was the first time I knew that... ...you were the woman that I wanted to dance all my dances with.
Oh, crap.
Our table will be ready in a few minutes.
Why, do you have another boyfriend in there?
No.
We only mess around at his place.
I started it, but now it's scaring me, so could you come out here, please?
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
You got a wedding dress?
Yeah, but I'm not keeping it.
Then why can't I see it?
Oh.
I guess you can.
But I have to return it, so you can't like it.
Okay, I promise.
I'll hate it.
Wow.
You look hideous.
Really?
Yeah.
That's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen.
Why do you have to return it?
Because it doesn't really fit.
Oh, by the way, I booked The Swing Kings.
Oh, that's great.
Thanks.
But that dress is terrible.
It makes me want to rip it off you.
Okay.
But you can't rip it.
Well, maybe a little.
Guys, you want to look at the song list for the wedding?
Guys?
I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
All right, what's going on?
I'm sorry.
I should probably leave you girls alone.
Laugh all you want, but in 10 minutes, we'll have youngerlooking skin.
You know, she could use a little... Oh, nice shot!
Yeah
What's this?
Oh, right!
It's that girl's phone number.
There it is.
Just a phone number... ...a really hot girl gave me.
It's no big deal.
I mean, it is her home phone number, but...
Almost lost this baby!
The lovely Amanda gives me her number, and I go and drop it.
Thank you.
Hi, guys!
This is Josh.
Josh, these are my friends.
And that's Ross.
Dudes.
You played in college?
I still do.
Next year, I hope to make varsity.
Didn't you play soccer in high school?
No, wait.
You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
It's getting late.
I gotta get to the game, so I'm gonna...head.
I'll miss you.
Dope!
Wow!
Cute one.
Very cute.
I know.
Isn't he great?
So nice to finally be in a fun relationship, you know?
There's nothing boring about him.
I bet he's never set foot in a museum.
Maybe he'll get to go soon.
Like on a class trip or something.
You know what else is great about him?
What is the word for an adult... ...who doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
What was that?
Monica knows.
It's this dumb thing that Ross made up to try to fool our parents.
It's a way of giving the finger without actually having to give it.
I cried the night you made that up.
It was the first time I realized I was cooler than my big brother.
So Amanda just dropped me off.
That's one of the things I love about her.
She's old enough to drive.
You're not going to Mom and Dad's tonight?
No, sorry.
Where's Amanda?
Could you get me some cough drops?
I'm thinking you could bring her... ...and you guys could go up to your old room and not make out.
Cough drop, please?
At least she's not going out with me... ...to get into Rrated movies.
Why don't you just marry her?
Wait, you can't!
I forgot.
She's not a lesbian.
Amanda and I have a You have nothing!
You're not even going out!
You're her babysitter.
You have a 12yearold girl's job!
That is so sad.
And what are you laughing at, Miss Mykegsuckingboyfriend... ...isstealingfromme?
So he stole a couple bucks from me.
Big deal!
At least he got me something with it.
That's mine!
Would you both please start acting like adults?
And give me my cough drops!
Fine.
Sorry.
Here.
Thank you.
At least I made $10 in my relationship.
You know...?
Parading goats are parading Parading down the street Parading goats are parading Leaving little treats Does it even work without my sexy voice?
I like it.
Gunther, kiss me.
You look..   stopeating hot!
Which is like the highest level of hotness.
Okay, are you sure?
Because I am really dreading going to this party.
Then don't go.
Mike knows I'm coming.
If I don't show up, he'll think it's because of him..   and then I'm gonna lose face.
That's a very serious thing in my culture.
All right, then you go to that party, and you pretend to be over Mike.
Afterward, you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk.
You got it.
Okay.
But not on the wine that you made, okay?
Because I just don't want to go back to the emergency room.
David?
Phoebe!
Hi.
Oh, my God!
Hi.
Wow!
You look unbelievable.
Oh, yeah, well..   What are you doing here?
Well, I'm back from Minsk.
Permanently.
Well, what happened?
Remember how I was trying to achieve..   the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?
Yeah.
Well, after eight years of research, I discovered..   that it can't be done.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well..   great that you're back.
How are you?
Good.
Good.
Life is good.
Good.
Well, I'm seeing someone.
Good for you.
Yeah.
She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and..
It's actually because of you that we're together.
I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy..   and I just said, "Boy, I want that."
Mike and I broke up.
You're kidding me.
Because I'm not seeing anybody.
I just totally made that up.
Really?
I don't know why, I'm sorry.
I guess I just didn't want to lose face.
I understand.
Yeah.
Okay.
So then, okay..
So we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone.
That's so not like us.
Yeah, I know.
Well, this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that..   but do you have someplace that you need to be right now?
Well..   No.
Well, do you want to get a drink?
I'd love to.
Great.
Okay.
Do you smell beets?
All right, stay upwind of me.
Hey, there's Phoebe.
Is that Mike she's with?
No, that's David.
There's a third guy?
Tip of the iceberg.
Okay, next word would be.
Chandler.
Chandler is my name and.
Hi!
Yes, you said that.
Yes!
Yes, I did.
But what I didn't say, what I wanted to say was, would you like to go out with me?
Thank you.
Good night.
Chandler?
There he is!
I didn't know you could dance!
She said yes!
She said yes!
Awful play, man!
Her name's Aurora.
She's Italian and she pronounces my name "Chandler. "
I like that better.
The usher gave me this to give to you.
What is it?
The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency.
An agency left me its card.
Maybe they wanna sign me!
Based on this play?
Based on this play!
Hey, kids!
No, because this line is passion, and this is just a line.
I've been here seven seconds, and you haven't asked me how my date went.
How was your date, Chandler?
It was unbelievable!
I've never met anyone like her.
She's had the most amazing life!
She was in the Israeli army.
None of the bullets hit the engine block, so we made it to the border.
But just barely and I, I've been talking about myself all night long.
I'm sorry.
What about you?
Tell me your stories.
All right, once, once I got on the subway, right?
And it was at night and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn just for the hell of it.
We talked till 2.
It was this perfect evening.
More or less.
Suddenly, we realized we were in Yemen.
I'm sorry, so "we" is "We" is me and Rick.
Who's Rick?
My husband.
Oh, so you're divorced?
No.
I'm sorry.
So you're widowed?
Hopefully?
No, I'm still married.
So how would your husband feel about you sitting here with me sliding your foot so far up my leg you can count the change in my pocket?
Don't worry.
I imagine he'd be okay with you because he's okay with Ethan.
Ethan?
There's an Ethan?
Ethan is my boyfriend.
What?!
What kind of relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
I suppose, mainly sexual.
I'm sorry it didn't work out.
What not work out?
I'm seeing her again on Thursday.
Didn't you listen to the story?
How could you get involved with a woman like this?
I had trouble with it at first.
But I get all the good stuff.
All the fun, all the talking, all the sex and no responsibility.
This is every guy's fantasy!
That is not true.
Ross, is this your fantasy?
No, of course not.
Yeah.
Yeah, it is.
You'd go out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
I couldn't.
Good for you.
When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
You know monogamy can be a tricky concept.
I mean, anthropologically speaking.
Fine.
Now you'll never know.
We're kidding.
Tell us.
We wanna know.
Come on!
All right.
There's a theory put forth by Richard Leakey.
It's the guy who wells up every time the Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device.
Hi, Mike's place.
Hey, it's Mike.
Ooh, that was fast!
Oh, ah,  no, she's not here yet.
You know, I think I'm gonna just take off  and break up with her over the phone.
No, you can't do that!
Oh, come on, Mike.
strap on a pair.
Why don't you just tell her  that we got back together?
You know, women appreciate honesty.
We also... appreciate gentle spanking  once in a while .
Just FYI.
One more thing.
There might be a picture of  "Precious" on my coffee table.
Her name's Precious?
Is she a pure breed or  did you pick her up at the pound?
Anyway, I just want to give you a heads up.
Okay.
Oh, and you know if she gets upset,  just scratch her tummy and give her Liva snap.
Hi, I'm Precious.
Who are you?
I'm, I'm Phoebe.
Phoebe?
Mike's exgirlfriend Phoebe?
The love of his life?
That Phoebe?
Okay, bye.
Alright so Mike's... on his way over.
You thought you guys were meeting here and  he thought you were meeting at the restaurant.
So you know ...doesn't really matter  who's right or wrong.
The point is...
I'm gonna take off.
Wait a minute.
I'm not letting you leave  until you tell me what's going on here.
I mean, are you guys  getting back together or something?
Alright.
Susie, can I call you Susie?
My name is Precious.
I can't say that.
Um, Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you.
Mike and I are back together  and um unfortunately that effectively ends  your relationship with him.
And he's very sorry about that and wishes you  the best of luck in all your endeavors.
I just can't believe this.
Why?
Well, I don't ...  Why would he do this?
I mean what's wrong with me?
Nothing.
There's nothing wrong with you.
I don't know what the hell am I supposed to do now!
Damn it, woman.
Pull yourself together!
Have some pride for the love of God!
Ok, not a fan of the tough love.
I just can't believe that  Mike didn't give me any warning.
But he didn't really know.
You know, he wasn't planning on  coming to Barbados and proposing to me.
He proposed to you?
This is the worst birthday ever!
Look,...
Precious.
Mike's not worth this.
You're an attractive, intelligent woman and  let's face it.
Mike's kind of a Wang.
I mean he proposed to me  while he was still seeing you.
He was gonna break up with you on your birthday?
And I don't like to kiss and tell  but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.
Oh my God.
You know, maybe you're right!
Maybe I don't need him.
I deserve to be treated with respect.
Screw you, Mike.
You're a coward and a bastard  and I hope you rot in hell.
You're welcome.
She's an FBI agent posing as a beauty contestant
Do you ever worry that you'll be walkingand your baby will just slip out?
What college was that, Dina?
Oh, my God.
Bobby?
Hi, Dina.
Good to see you.
Joey, what are you doing?Just what needs to be done.
Dearly beloved, we're gathered here..This is crazy.
Don't interrupt mewhen I'm talking to God!
Where were we?
Do you take this man..?No!
You'll take him.No, I won't!
You don't get a say.Yes, I do.
I heard "l do."
We're halfway there.
You.All right, Joey, that is enough!
As beautiful and movingas this ceremony is, this is not legal.
They don't have a marriage license orwitnesses, and the groom only has one shoe.
Yeah, he took the other one offand hit me with it.
What am I supposed to do?
You're supposed to realize they are adultsand that can make their own decisions.
No, they can't.
They werestupid enough to get knocked up!
Contraceptives are notalways effective.
Right?
Yeah.
We kind of didn't use any.Come on, kids, a little help here!
Just because they're not gettingmarried doesn't mean it's a disaster.
Maybe they have a plan.Oh, okay, let's hear their plan.
Now, what's the future look likefor Dina and Bobby?
Well..
I really have high hopes for my band.
You were right.
He is funny.Now, wait a minute.
I bet when you told people you wantedto be an actor, they laughed at you.
Come on, Bobby,tell us a little bit about your band.
Well, it's just me and my pal Rooster.The band's name is Numbnuts.
Really?
If you're having a baby,you should be married.
Even if it is to Bobby.Dude, that's not a compliment.
I knew you wouldn't be supportive.So, what are you gonna do?
Have the baby and raise it by yourself?Without a husband?
You can't be a single mother alone!You're gonna ruin your life!
Excuse me.
Am I ruining my life?No, it's different for you.
You're so strong.
You're not some dumb kidwho doesn't know what she's doing.
Excuse me?One pregnant woman at a time, please!
I just want you to be okay.
So forcing her to marry Bobbyis gonna make that happen?
Maybe.
Yeah.
So, what kind of musicdoes Numbnuts..?
Oh, forget it!
I can't!
I am scared to death about this.
But Ithink I can do it.
I just need some help.
Bobby's gonna be here the whole time.You bet I am.
And to answer your earlier question,we're straightup gangster rap.
Look, Rachel's told me how much easieryou've made all this on her.
Why can't you do that for me?Because you're my baby sister!
And you're my big brother.
You'remy favorite guy in the whole world.
I'm not even scared to tell Mom and Dad.I was scared of telling you.
I'd be scared of them, but all right.
I can't stand the thought of havingthis baby with you mad at me.
I want him to have his uncle.
Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?
Of course he's gonna havehis Uncle Joey.
We'll be all right.
Even if we're notmarried, this baby will be so loved.
And not just by us.That's right.
By his uncle too.
And by you.
Bobby, why don't we come over here andlet them have a little moment, okay?
Come here.
No, seriously, what's wrong with you?
You're gonna love me so much.I got Sting tickets!
Are you tired?
You better believe he's tired after the day we had!
If you know what I mean.
Do you know what I mean?
Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
Do you like that badge I got you?
Oh, yeah, it's so cool.
Now, I gotta go.
Officer Bing's got a 10100.
That's peepee.
Phoebe, you have a twig in your hair.
We kind of took a detour on our way over here.
We were strolling through the park and no one was around, so... You didn't.
We did!
We violated section 12, paragraph 7 of the criminal code.
The park, huh?
Public place.
I hear you.
Can you excuse me for a second?
Hi, Chandler.
Monica, this is the men's room.
Isn't it?
Yes, it is.
I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual.
Haven't you?
No.
And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out.
But come on, this is getting ridiculous.
Come on, we can't let them win!
We've proved that we are hot, okay?
So why are you obsessed about this?
Phoebe and Gary are in that... ..."can't keep their hands off each other" phase!
So?
It makes me really sad that we're not really there anymore.
Oh, is that what this has all been about?
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were... ...all over each other all the time?
Yeah, that was great.
That was really great.
But the truth is, I'm more excited about where we are now.
Really?
Yeah.
I've never been in a relationship this long before.
To get past the beginning and still want to be around each other...
...I think that's incredible.
And the fact that this is happening with you...
...I think that's pretty exciting.
That's so sweet.
I know that I was acting a little crazy... ...but I feel the same way.
You know what I just realized?
You just freaked out about our relationship.
I did not.
Yes, you did!
Admit it.
You freaked out!
I freaked out a little.
A little?
You freaked out bigtime, okay?
And I fixed it!
We have switched places.
I am the relationship king, and you are the crazy, irrational screwup!
And now we're back.
I cannot believe Ross is buying this.
Thank God!
I can't watch him anymore.
You guys ready?
By the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
Man, they cannot get enough
Sound alike too.
So, Mondler... What are you doing?
What does it look like?
I am cleaning.
Did you get Monica's authorization to move all her stuff?
I don't need that.
I'll put everything back.
Put it back exactly where you found it?
Yes.
I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
First of all, that attitude is not helping.
She won't care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Hello?
Did you just meet Monica?
She'll recognize that I did a nice thing... and appreciate it.
Actually, this will work out well.
Because when you move back with Joey... Joey's hot new roommate can come live with me.
Oh, I see.
You're trying to freak me out.
Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind of stuff, all right?
Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years.
She's going to freak out.
Oh, my God.
She's going to sit on you.
That probably won't hurt as much anymore.
I'll prove it to you.
I'll call her right now.
Phone's done.
Hey, Mon.
How's it going?
Terrible.
If I want something done right, I have to do it myself.
Other people just wreck stuff.
Is this in the right place?
Who cares?
I repel women.
You can't come in here!
Ross is naked!
I couldn't say I was naked, because she's allowed to see me naked.
Why does anyone have to be naked?
Why is Ross naked?
I had to show Chandler something.
Naked?
I guess I have... a "guy" problem.
Is it the same thing Chandler had?
We'll get everything squared away, and you can come back later!
There's still some of Chandler's medicine in the bathroom.
Bye.
Bye!
Thank God.
Dude, what'd you have?
We have no time, okay?
We must focus.
We've got to get everything back into its original place.
The photo album!
There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album.
We just match everything to the pictures!
That's perfect!
That's brilliant!
What'd you have?
Can I come in now?
Why is everything different?
Bye.
I don't see anything different... other than the fact that the room got brighter when you came into it.
The end table is wrong, the couch looks bizarre... and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
Okay, don't be mad, okay?
After I unpacked the boxes, I wanted to do something nice for you... so I cleaned the apartment.
So I moved everything around, and then I forgot... where it went back.
I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry.
That's okay.
Are you afraid of me or something?
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Of course not.
My gosh, Chandler, what you did is a wonderful thing... and I really appreciate it.
I have this thing where I want everything in the perfect place.
But I'd never expect you to worry about that.
Really?
Of course.
Oh, you're the best.
You come here to me.
Hold on, okay?
First things first.
Did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?

But, of course, it went right in one ear...
I love how he cares so much about stuff.
If I squint, I can pretend he's Alan Alda.
Oh, good.
Another dinosaur story.
When are those gonna become extinct?
If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible... ...that would be the best.
What does Rachel see in this guy?
I love Rachel.
I wish she was my wife.
Who's singing?
The One With the Race Car Bed When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days... ...who were you?
He has this thing.
Did you have fun with Joey last night?
Yeah, we went to the Knicks game.
That's nice.
Then we went to a bar, and he hooked us up with all these women.
Women?
You mean, like old women?
Kind of old, like 30.
I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars... ...but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.
That's great.
Joey must have really taught you some stuff.
A little.
How you doing?
So I heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
Yeah, that guy's all right.
Yeah, and you had fun teaching him how to be all "Joey."
What?
You know, all the women.
You can't teach someone to be good with women.
That's why I never had any luck with Chandler.
I'm right here.
Would you mind just not going out with him again?
Just the idea of you, and he, and all these women...
I know he's my assistant, and I can't date him!
But it just bothers me, all right?
No, no, no, you can't take him away from me.
I got a great partner to pick up girls with.
Finally!
I'm still right here.
Will you at least talk to him... ...and tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this datingtonsofwomen thing is?
What?
I just don't want him to meet anybody until I'm over my crush.
And I will get over it.
It's not like I love him.
It's just physical.
I get crushes like this all the time.
I had a crush on you at first.
I know.
Monica told me.
Did you have a crush on me when we first met?
Yeah, sure.
Can you people not see me?
Will you talk to him?
I don't know, Rach.
I'll give you 10 free Ralph Lauren shirts.
One.
No, 10.
You said 10.
You can't take that back.
You wanted to talk to me?
I don't know.
You got something for me?
Yeah, this is from Rachel.
Ten.
Okay.
Tag, there's such a thing as too many women.
Really?
Yeah, for you.
Hi.
Hey, so, what'd you do last night?
Went out with Joey.
Yeah?
Another night of birddogging the chicas?
No, we had a really good talk.
I don't think I'm gonna do that bar scene anymore.
Wow, I did not see that coming.
It's just not really who I am.
I've always been happier when... Why am I telling you this?
You don't care about this stuff.
Yes, I do.
You were saying, "I'm happier when I..." When I'm in a relationship.
I love having a girlfriend.
Really?
Someone I can spoil, you know.
Spoil?
Let me ask you something.
Do you believe there's one perfect person for everyone?
I'm starting to.
If that person's in your life, should you do something about it?
Yes.
Hell, yes.
All right, then, it's settled.
I'm getting back together with my ex.
I would love to!
What?
Hello?
This is gonna be a while.
Pheebs, you were right about her.
That went well.
Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.
Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.
I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff.
Who the hell are you?
Who the hell are you?
I'm the hell person whose office this is.
Good one, Rach.
I'm Gavin Mitchell, the person who's taking over your job.
Excuse me?
Your baby's so cute.
But why would you put a pink bow on a boy?
Hey, Joey.
Listen, sudden change of plans.
My maternity leave just ended.
They said if I didn't come back today, they'd fire me.
What?
No, that's illegal.
I'll have the Labor Department here so fast, they won't..   All right, calm down, Norma Rae.
They didn't actually say that.
I'm just afraid if I don't come back now, this guy will try and squeeze me out.
But what about Emma?
I mean, we don't have a nanny.
I know.
We're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight.
Can you please just take care of her for today?
Absolutely.
Just give me your breasts, and we'll be on our way.
Come on.
I don't know what else to do.
Fine.
Fine.
We'll have fun, won't we?
Yes, we will.
Yes, we..   Ross.
You're pretty.
Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to.
Well, I've changed your screen saver from that picture of *NSYNC.
Hey, they were popular when I left.
I'm working on this big presentation for tomorrow.
I should be involved in that, so get me up to speed.
That'll take weeks.
Let me take care of the presentation.
No.
I see what you're doing here, all right?
This is my job, buddy.
I've had it for five years, and I know how it works.
So why don't you just catch me up.
Fine.
Oh, God.
You've totally messed with the back support on my chair.
How do you fix this?
You've been here five years.
You figure it out.
Fine, I will.
All right, fill me in.
You're here already.
Yes.
Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation.
Actually, I made a few changes.
I think I'm caught up on everything.
So ask me anything.
How do you fix the chair?
Except that!
Hello, Mr. Zelner.
We are all ready for our presentation this afternoon.
Good, because it's in 10 minutes.
What?
I can't do that.
I have the baby.
Ross is not gonna pick her up for an hour.
Then Gavin can give the presentation.
We have to do it now.
Ralph needs to leave early today.
He's going helicopter shopping.
But I love that man.
Well, there you go, you win.
You win.
You get to do the presentation.
You'll knock them dead.
No one will remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter..   and Super Gavin will just fly right alongside of him.
You can do the presentation.
No, I can't.
I have a baby.
I'll watch her.
Why would you do that?
Because you worked really hard, and it's your job.
And you're a little crazy.
That's really nice.
I should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable.
Well, you're not gonna like what's coming.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm really fine.
Don't worry.
I'm great with children.
Gavin Mitchell.
Pleased to meet you.
Hey  Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.
Yeah!
So you're gonna call this one back?
No  What are you talking about?
Sarah's great!
Oh, really?
You know what your great friend did?
We're out to dinner, ok?
We're getting along, having a really nice time.
I was thinking she was really cool.
And then, out of nowhere...    That¡¯s it?
That¡¯s why you won¡¯t go out with her again?
So, she took some fries, big deal!
Hey, hey, look!
It¡¯s not about a few fries... it¡¯s about what the fries represent.
What?
ALL FOOD!!
I¡¯m sorry, I can¡¯t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Look.
I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants!
The more, the better!
All right?
Just don¡¯t order a garden salad and then eat my food!
That's good way to lose some fingers!
Oh.
Hi.
Thank God you¡¯re here.
Listen to this!
What?
Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...  Oh!
Oh, no!
What?
You know about the, the, the plate thing?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I know.
Joey doesn¡¯t share food.
I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate...  You wouldn¡¯t let her have a grape?
Oh no!
Not me!
Emma!
JOEY DOESN¡¯T SHARE FOOD!
I really am sorry about, you know..before.
I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you.
Sure.
Just not as much as clams.
Well, stuffed clams.
Chocolate Torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman.
Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.
Yes, that's Raspberry coule.
So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to be healthy.
Oh my God!
Mmmm!
Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead.
Oh, I'm sorry sir, that was our last piece.
Mmmm!
Mmm!
Oh, no!
This is work.
I should call in.
Can you excuse me?
Oh yeah, sure.
No problem.
What are you doing?
I thought you don't share food.
Sure I do.
Coule?
No.
If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert.
This is a two way street.
Really?
Really!
Now this all better be here when I come back.
Yeah, of course.
I can control myself.
Stop staring at me!
Why, just a tiny little...    Ohoh!
I'm not even sorry.
Hi.
Hey Hey  So, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption.
Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.
So, why are you still wearing it?
Because it's soft...    Hey, so how was your date?
Ooh... Not so good.
Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?
Yeah, and you know what?
We could do a lot worse.
JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD
Martha Lugwin's daughter is going to call you.
What's that curry taste?
Curry.
I think they're great.
I really do.
Remember the Lugwins?
The big one had a thing for you.
They all had a thing for him!
Oh, Mom!
Why is this girl going to call me?
She just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, food or I don't know.
I told her you had a restaurant.
I don't have a restaurant.
I work in a restaurant.
They don't have to know that.
Ross, help me with the spaghetti.
Oh, we're having spaghetti.
That's easy.
This'll sound unbelievably selfish on my part but did you plan on bringing up the baby/lesbian thing?
It'd take the heat off of me.
What Rachel did to her life!
We ran into her parents at the club.
They were not playing very well.
I won't say what they spent on that wedding but $40,000 is a lot of money.
At least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar.
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing.
It's an expression.
No, it's not.
Don't listen to her!
You've always been independent.
Even when you were a kid, and you were chubby and you had no friends, you were just fine.
You'd read alone in your room.
And your puzzles.
There are people, like Ross, who need to shoot for the stars.
With his museum and his papers getting published.
Others are satisfied as they are.
I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.
I read about women trying to have it all, and I thank God our little Harmonica doesn't have that problem.
So, Ross, what's going on with you?
Any stories?
No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
Look, I realize you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me.
So here's the deal.
Carol's a lesbian.
She's living with a woman named Susan.
She's pregnant with my child.
And she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
And you knew about this?
You went on our honeymoon alone?
What is this about you being arrested in London?
Your mom was arrested?
I'm busy beaming with pride.
This is kind of embarrassing but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man.
Why would she say that's embarrassing?
I just get this craving for Kung Pao chicken.
That's too much information!
So now you're doing this book tour.
How's that going?
Oh, fine.
I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate.
But I get to see my son, who I love!
This is the way that I find out.
Most moms use the phone.
Don 't take this wrong, I just don 't see you as a mom somehow.
I don 't mean that bad.
Oh, no.
I'm a fabulous mom!
I bought my son his first condoms.
And then he burst into flames.
Let's see.
"Congress is debating a new deficitreduction bill.
How about Agamemnon?
Way too special.
I'm famished.
What do I want?
Please, God, don't let it be Kung Pao chicken.
You watched the show!
What did you think?
I think you need to come out of your shell.
What is this dive?
Only you could've picked this place.
Come on.
Shut up.
It's fun.
Give me a hug.
I think we're ready for some tequila.
I know I am.
Who's doing shots?
Hit me.
There you go.
Ross?
I'm not really a shotdrinking kind of guy.
Hi!
Sorry we're late.
We kind of just, you know, lost track of time.
But a man can change.
Anyone want me to appraise anything?
Mrs. Bing, I've read everything you've ever written.
When I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
Oh, please, honey.
If I can do it, anybody can.
Start with half a dozen European cities throw in 30 euphemisms for male genitalia and you have got yourself a book!
My mother, ladies and gentlemen!
Yeah, any messages for room 226?
You okay, slugger?
Oh, yeah.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
What is with you tonight?
Nothing.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
Okay, thank you.
It's the Italian handlicker, isn't it?
No.
It's the one he's licking.
She's supposed to be with you.
You're good.
I have sold 100 million copies of my books, and you know why?
The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
No, because I know how to write men that women fall in love with.
Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo.
People will not turn 325 pages for a Paolo.
Come on.
The guy's a secondary character.
He's just a complication you eventually kill off.
When?
He's not a hero.
You know who our hero is?
The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
No, it's you.
Please.
No, really.
Come on.
You're smart.
You're sexy.
Right.
Come on, kiddo.
You're gonna be fine, believe me.
I'll just pee in the street.
Is Chandler here?
Really?
It's just like everyone else's apartment.
It's got rooms and walls and ceilings.
I just wanted to see where you live.
Give me the tour.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
This is the living room.
That's nice.
And this is the kitchen.
That's real pretty.
Wait a minute.
Don't I get to see the bedroom?
The bedroom.
Well, it's pretty much your typical... ...bedroom.
We're still on this side of the door.
But I didn't get to see it.
Oh, shoot.
Maybe next time.
Thanks for a lovely evening.
So who is she?
That was the blind date that I told you about.
She called and switched it from Tuesday.
Did you like her?
I'm just asking as a friend because I am totally fine with this.
Well, you seem fine.
Okay, you know what?
I'm not fine.
I'm not.
I mean, how could I be fine?
Hearing you come in with her.
She wants to see your bedroom.
You know what?
What if we're friends... ...who don't see other people?
You mean like exclusive friends?
Why not?
I mean, this has been the most amazing week.
Would it be so terrible?
Even if we were friends who lived together?
Or maybe someday, friends who stood up in front of their other friends... ...and vowed to be friends forever.
You know, we're back where we were.
Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed.
That's not true.
You don't have a mustache.
Okay, one thing's changed.
But we still want different things, and we know how this is gonna end.
You know what?
I gotta walk out of here right now... ...because getting over you is the hardest thing I have ever had to do.
I don't think I could do it again.
I know I couldn't.
Yeah.
So... How about one last game of racquetball?
Watch the thorns!
What?
Beth is really, really sick.
Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she can do.
Joey?
Yeah.
You wanna put the book in the freezer
Where's my boy?
Here's my boy!
And here's his Barbie!
What's my boy doing with a Barbie?
He picked it out at the store.
He loves it.
He carries it everywhere, like a security blanket.
But with ski boots and a kicky beret.
Yeah, it's cute.
Why does he have it again?
So he's got a doll.
So what?
Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up to be... ...in show business.
This wouldn't have to do with the fact... ...that he's being raised by two women?
You know what?
It's fine.
If you're okay with the Barbie thing, so am I.
Give Daddy the Barbie.
Give me the Barbie.
Don't you wanna play with a monster truck?
No?
Okay.
How about a DinoSoldier?
You are so pathetic.
Why can't your son just play with his doll?
I gotta go to work.
Has anybody seen my left boob?
I loved that movie.
Here it is.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
It just felt nice.
It's the toughest guy in Toyland, Ben!
Real American hero I'm G.I.
Joe!
Drop the Barbie.
Drop the Barbie.
G.I.
Joe?
You really think he'll fall for that?
G.I.
Joe?
Cool!
Can I play?
Look, Ben!
It's a toy that protects U.S. Oil interests overseas!
Go, Joe!
G.I.
Joe?
G.I.
Joe?!
I don't know what to tell you guys.
That's the doll he chose.
What'd you do, dip it in sugar?
Look, G.I.
Joe's in, Barbie's out.
And if you guys can't deal with it, that's just your too bad.
What are you being such a weenie for?
So he has a Barbie.
Big deal.
You used to dress up like a woman.
What?
The way you used to dress up in Mom's clothes?
What are you talking about?
The big hat, the pearls, the little pink handbag?
Okay.
You are totally making this up.
How can you not remember?
You made us call you "Bea"?
Oh, God.
I've literally never been this happy.
Wasn't there a little song?
Oh, please, God, let there be a song.
There was no song.
There was no song.
I am Bea  Okay.
I drink tea...  That's enough.
Won't you...?
Won't you dance around with me?
I am Bea I drink tea Won't you dance around with...?
Did she call?
No.
Sorry.
Maybe I should call her.
Forget her, man.
You don't need her.
He's right.
What she did was unforgivable.
Well, yeah, but, you know, what if I was wrong?
How might you be wrong?
What if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?
Tell me she told you this.
She didn't have to tell me.
I saw the play.
There was no heat.
Back me up.
That's all you're basing this on?
That's not backing me up!
Look, you said, "With the offstage and the heat" That was just a theory.
There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out: Lone gunman, communism, geometry.
Oh, my God!
"Would you like to go to a basketball game with?"
I just wanted to come over to say that I'm sorry.
I acted like the biggest idiot in the world.
I can completely understand why you were so upset.
I really wish you'd called me.
Yeah, I know.
I wish I had too.
I think this is a good thing.
We've had our first fight, and now we can move on.
I know for me, but Nick's pants?
I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
For next time, what do you say?
"I have an extra ticket."
"An extra ticket."
Not "two tickets."
The first time you asked a guy out he turned you down?
He didn't turn me down.
He's at the game.
I got the date.
I'm just not on it.
Okay, it's ready.
Come on.
What's ready?
Just come.
Oh, my God!
This is beautiful!
Did you work for two days straight?
Pretty much.
What do you think of the floor?
I don't know.
Looks the same.
You used to have carpet.
Oh, yeah.
I made snacks.
Please, just hang out.
I'm just gonna rest my eyes for just a little bit.
Do you want us to come back later?
No, no, no.
Stay.
Just keep talking.
I'm always the hostess.
How'd it go?
She wasn't sleeping with him.
Good!
She is now.
What are you saying?
I'm saying that she is a devil woman.
You think you know a person, then they turn around and sleep with Nick.
Nick and his rockhard pecs and his giant mannipples.
I hate him.
And I hate her.
I don't hate her.
I love her.
This is all my fault.
How?
How is it your fault?
I should have called.
If I had called her, she never would have gone out with Nick.
They wouldn't have ended up in bed.
I threw her at his mannipples!
This is not your fault.
Your fight does not justify her sleeping with someone.
Well, if she thought they were on a break... Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold, a Joshua Burgen.
Really?
Will you call him?
Yes, I will.
Absolutely.
Hello, Rachel.
Hi, Joshua.
I left my wallet here on purpose.
Really?
Yes.
I just wanted to see you again.
I'm glad.
Rachel, I'd like to say something to you.
Yes?
"How you doing?
That's like two birds to you too, Helen!
Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.
Okay, send her in.
Come on in.
You wanted to see me?
I was just going over your data.
You've been postdating your Friday numbers.
Which is bad, because?
It throws my WENUS out of whack.
Excuse me?
WENUS.
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Statistics.
Right.
Gotcha, gotcha.
Won't happen again.
I wouldn't want to do anything to hurt your WENUS.
It's not just that she's cute, okay?
It's just that she's really, really cute.
It doesn't matter.
You don't dip your pen in the company ink.
Ross.
Your little creature's got the remote again.
How's it going, sir?
It's been better.
The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.
It's pretty ugly.
We haven't seen an ANUS this bad since the '70s.
What's it mean?
We'll be laying off people.
I know I was late last week.
I slept funny and my hair was snarly.
Not you.
Relax.
Ever have to fire anyone?
Nina.
Nina.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Yes, I am.
Listen, the reason that I called you in here today was.
Please don't hate me.
What?
Would you like to have dinner sometime?
So, what do you want for your birthday?
And that's the Chrysler Building right there.
Mr. Douglas.
Cool tie.
She's still here.
Yes.
Yes, she is.
Didn't I memo you?
After I let her go, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flanan, Dr. Flan.
And he informed me that she took the news rather badly.
In fact, he mentioned the word "frenzy. "
She seems so.
Oh, no, no.
Nina?
She's.
In fact, if you asked her now she'd have no recollection of being fired at all.
That's unbelievable.
And yet believable.
So I decided not to fire her again until I'm sure she will be of no threat to herself or others.
I see.
You never really know what's going on inside a person's head.
Well, I guess that's why they call it psychology, sir.
Do you have a sec?
Sure, Nina.
What's up?
For the past few days, people have been avoiding me and giving me strange looks.
Oh, well, maybe that's because they're jealous of us.
Maybe.
But that doesn't explain why they keep taking my scissors.
Well, maybe that's because you're getting a big raise!
I am?
Sure.
Why not?
Oh, my God!
You're amazing!
Oh, you don't know.
Helen, make sure we do the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder's raise.
You still want me to send her psychological profile to personnel?
Helen drinks.
Will you marry me?
I ended up telling her everything.
How'd she take it?
Pretty well.
Except for the stapler thing.
Little tip.
If you're ever in a similar situation never, ever leave your hand on the desk.
Okay, I think I get how to do this.
No, there's no time to go to bakery.
We're just gonna come home.
Everybody left?
Alright, well, just tell Emma  that we'll be there as soon as we can.
Bye.
Rachel!
/ No!
God, sorry.
I can't believe they gave you a ticket.
You're such a good driver.
Emma's awake.
Yeah?
I can't believe this.
This is her first birthday.
She's awake.
We're not even there.
Everybody left.
We still have the stupid obscene cake.
Well, maybe I can fix that.
You know?
Try to, try to turn it into something else.
Oh, don't even bother.
I've already ruined her first birthday.
Do you know how important  these early experiences are, Ross?
Very.
According to the back cover of  that book you gave me.
Rach, she's not gonna remember this.
I guess.
Oh, I just had such an idea  what this day would be like.
You know?
Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake  singing happy birthday.
Then we would  all go into the...  Hey, get off the road, you stupid student driver!
They have to learn!
Hey, this isn't that bad.
Oh my God!
Look, you made it into a bunny!
How did you do that?
Well, I just made these two things, um,cheeks .
And then I split this to make ears.
Wel,, I'm very impressed.
Some can sing.
Some can dance.
I apparently can turn phallic cakes  into woodland creatures   Another way to organize your stuffed animals  is by size.
I'm sorry.
Is this a game for Emma or for Monica?
Game?
Emma, do you even know it's your birthday today?
You're one.
One year old.
That's little.
Huh!
That's my girl!
That's how old you are.
Did I teach her that?
Did I just impart wisdom?
I want one.
Me too.
There's no one around.
Why don't we just take this one?
And head to Canada.
I was kidding.
I wasn't!
Let's get going!
Hey.
Are Ross and Rachel back?
No, not yet.
Oh good!
I didn't miss the party.
What about your massage client?
I just felt so bad missing this  so I just slipped him a little something.
You know, as long as I'm back in 5 or 6 hours,  it will be alright.
Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask,  I've been here the whole time.
The whole time!
I've been here the whole time.
Joey, we just saw you come in.
You ran past us on the stairs.
I don't care that you left.
I'm just glad that you're here.
Thanks you guys.
Hey guys, come on.
You've got to see what Emma just did.
What?
Emma, how old are you?
How old are you today?
Oh, Emma, that's right!
You're that many!
Oh my God!
Our daughter's a genius!
Rach, this means.../ No, no science camp  Damn it!
I'll put a candle on a cake.
Oh, Emma.
Look at your stuffed animals  lined up so neatly.
Thanks.
Okay, here we go!
Emma's first birthday cake.
Hey Emma, you want to blow out the cake?
Come on, Emma.
You can do it.
What's wrong?
Are you okay?
Oh, yeah, nothing.
It's happy tears.
This is just what I wanted.
Hey, you made it into a bunny.
What is wrong with me?!
It looked more delicious when it was a penis!
Okay / Okay, you ready?
Yeah.
And... record / okay  Hi Emma.
Well, your first birthday is over.
And it was weird....   Go, go , go , Alan  Wrong!
Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas.
Drums?
No, drums!
Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
I'm sorry.
But not that sorry, because you don't have to live with it.
We have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Okay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
Fortyfive minutes?
We have tickets to The Music Man at 8.
I'm sorry.
Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
Is this because of the burrito thing?
You need to give him money.
Give him money?
It was a joke!
No.
To get a table.
Places like this are always shaking you down.
Everybody wants a payoff.
All right, calm down, O'Malley.
I'll slip him some money.
But you've got to be smooth about it.
Hey, I can be smooth.
We're in a bit of a hurry, so if you could get us a table... ...a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
Of course, sir.
Okay.
How'd it go?
Had the money in the wrong hand.
Hey.
Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money.
How do you know so much about this?
I don't know.
Richard used to do it, didn't he?
We'd be eating our soup right now.
Mustached bastard.
Okay, those people just left.
Come on.
Quick, give him the money.
Excuse me.
We're in a bit of a hurry.
Can we...?
So you like the drums.
That's great.
You know, I was worried that they would create maybe... ...an unbearable living situation.
But, okay, well, apparently not.
So, yay!
Hey, Pheebs, we already learned a song.
Ready?
One, two, three, four.
Tequila!
That's fun.
Here you go.
Thank you, Gunther.
Put her there.
Definitely not easier with coins.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey, Pheebs.
Joey, you know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
What is rock 'n' roll about that?
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.
Hold it!
Before you tell me what it is...
What are you talking about?
I love them.
I had a tarantula when I was a kid.
But it died because my cat ate it.
And then my cat died.
But, Joey, isn't this cool?
Is it on me?
I feel like it's on me.
I got... Oh, isn't that adorable?
I understand why Superman is here... ...but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?
Did you get it?
I got it.
Is it back in the cage?
It's back in the cage.
Is the cage closed?
Joey, will you just come out here and stop being such a baby
Hi, We are buying the house next door and we were  wondering if we could just take a look around  Oh sure I'm showing it to someone else right now.
But please, look around  Thanks  Feel like cheating on our house  and if we're gonna cheat shouldn't it be with like a hot younger  house and does stuff our house won't do?
Ours is so much better  This livingroom is smaller, the dining room looks like  a cave, huh, what a hole!!
So, what do you think?
LOVE IT!
Well, We already have one offer on it and I think  the lady upstairs is going to make another one   They could be our neighbors.
What are they like?
Oh, the woman upstairs is very nice.
She and her  husband have two kids.
He is on Wallstreet and she's on... Oh~ My~ God!
And yet I never run into Beyonce!
You two know each other?
Oh, we go way back   before Monica made an honest man out of him  Chandler used to be my~ little love muffin  So, are you guys thinking of getting this house too?
Ooh.. Are we gonna have a bidding war?
I'd better warn you.
I'm a toughie  Don't.. Don't..  No, actually we are buying the house next door   wh..
WHY?!
I don't know why!
Ooh, that decides it then..
I was on the fence but knowing  that you two would be our neighbors.
Ah, now we have to get it.
Ellen, we're gonna talk numbers     This cannot be hanppening!
I mean never again will you have to hear the three  words that make your balls jump back up inside your body  Well, we have to do something.
We can't have her  living next door.
Huh, that does it too.
Bye~    "Out of Area" Boy, I'll say~    Well, I just talked to Sid.
We're definitely putting in an offer  on the house.
And I'll bet we get it  The Hitlers will be so disappointed  All right.
I gotta run.
Tell Monica I say good bye.
And..
I'll see you later.
Neighbor  Wait!
I just want you to know that I'm so happy  you're going to be here  Oh~ me too..   BECAUSE!
That way, we can pick up where we left off.
Huh?
I never stopped loving you  Oh~ My..  Yeah yeah yeah..
I want you, I need you, I must have you  Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein  Chandler, what are you talking about.
Now that you live next door, we can be together everyday.
Sid and Monica never have to know a thing  I don't know what to say  I mean.. obviously we have this heat between us    Obviously..
But I love my husband and I know you love your wife  I don't think we should get this house now  Don't say that.
Don't tangle the dream and take it away  Chandler, one of us has got to be strong  I understand  Although, maybe just one last moment of weakness    Good bye, Chandler Bing    They are never coming down now     Hi!
Hi!
I had no idea you were so excited about Paris  Uhm I mean.. you said you were scared  Well.. yeah..
What are you doing here?
Waiting for my grandma to finish my laundry.
What about you?
I'm here to see Mary Angela.
You are so the man!
Come on.
Now look, listen.
Listen... Be cool, because Grandma doesn't know about you two.
And you do not wanna tick her off.
She was, like, the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body.
Where are your parents?
This tiramisu is excellent.
Did you make it, Mary Angela?
No, I did.
Well, it's yummy.
So... Mary Angela, do you like it?
Of course.
It's her favorite.
So... Mary Angela, what's your second favorite?
More of Grandma's tiramisu.
Oh, would you just please... ...give me your recipe, because this is great!
It's topnotch!
That dies with me.
So will I.
Excuse yourself and go to the bathroom.
I was just squinting.
It doesn't mean anything.
Just do it!
Will you excuse me, I have to...
Finally!
I thought we'd never be alone.
Can I just tell you something?
I have not stopped thinking about you since the party.
Look, I may have jumped the gun here.
I just got out of a relationship... ...and I'm not really in a in a commitment kind of place.
So?
Me neither!
God, Mary Angela was right.
You do have the softest lips.
You're not Mary Angela?
No!
I'm Mary Therese!
This is so bad.
If you're not Mary Angela, then who is?
I am.
Oh, it's so bad.
Joey!
No Joey!
No Joey!
No Joey!
Joey.
What's going on?
You're it!
Now run and hide!
It's no big deal.
Chandler was just kissing me... ...because he thought I was Mary Angela.
What?
How could you think she was Mary Angela?
I wasn't sure which one Mary Angela was.
Look, I'm sorry.
I was really drunk and you guys all look really similar.
I say punch him, Joey!
Yeah, punch him!
We should all calm down... ...because your brother's not gonna punch me.
Are you?
That is usually what I would do.
But I never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it.
How could you do this?
Hey, where'd everybody go?
If you wanna punch me, go ahead.
I deserve it.
But I want you to know that I'd never soberly hurt you or your family.
You're my best friend.
And I would never do anything like this, ever again.
So what?
I say punch him!
Yeah, punch him!
No, I'm not gonna punch Chandler.
I'll do it.
No, you won't!
He knows he did a terrible thing, and I believe him.
He's sorry.
But you got one more apology to make.
You gotta apologize to Mary Angela.
Okay.
Absolutely.
You got it.
Well, let's see, I just got beat up by a girl...
They really got you guys.
Your TV, the chairs.
Your microwave, the stereo.
Man, he took the five of spades!
No, here it is.
Oh, my God!
What happened?
Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!
So how was your date?
Well, I always wanted to go out with Chip in high school.
Tonight, I actually went out with Chip in high school.
Honey, I'm sorry.
Not only did I get to go out with Chip...
...I got to dump Chip.
That's so great!
I know.
What did the insurance company say?
They said, "You don't have insurance.
Stop calling us."
You didn't tell her?
Okay, fine.
Listen... ...this cat belongs to a little girl.
There are flyers all over the place.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
We can take her back with you if you want.
But, you know, she chose to find me.
I have to respect her decision, right?
That's a good call.
That's right.
Enough is enough.
I'm sorry you feel guilty about spending time with your new mom.
But this isn't your old mom.
This is a cat.
Julio the cat.
Not Mom!
Cat.
Ross, how many parents have you lost?
None.
Then you don't know how it feels when one of them comes back.
I believe this is my mother.
Even if I'm wrong, who cares?
Just be a friend, okay?
Be supportive.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I don't know what to say.
You could say... ...you're sorry to her mom.
I think she would like that.
Come here.
Here, come here.
Mrs. Buffay?
Sorry about what I said.
It was insensitive of me to say... ...that you were just a cat... ...when, clearly, you are also... ...the reincarnated spirit... ...of my friend's mother.
Thank you.
We both forgive you.
What will you do about the little girl?
Listen.
Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me.
You're welcome to come back anytime.
If she'd come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it.
Come on.
I'll take you home.
I'll go with you.
Me too.
I got an extra futon.
Dude, you don't have to brag.
We got nothing here.
You know...
It's peaceful out here
You know that first batch of margaritas is not so great   but this second batch is gooood!
Well, maybe the next batch we could all get some.
Oh, yeah, well  this is fun, isn't it?
You know, just the four of us, just hanging.
Dude, are you okay?
and when are the fajitas gonna be ready?
I'm fine!
Okay?
I'm great .
I'm just, I'm just proud of us.
You know?
There's no weirdness, no tension.
No awareness.
Yeah, we make a great foursome.
We should do more stuff together.
Whooo!
Let's take a trip!
Okay?
Where do you think , we , we can go?
My fajitas!
Look, Charlie,   I just want you to know Ross is just having a little trouble   adjusting to the thought of Joey and me.
You know he normally doesn't drink like this.
Oh, you know what?
This is nothing.
My father is a raing alcoholic.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Have I made this evening uncomfortable?
Fajitas!
Be careful, very hot plate!
Very hot!
Everyone, I would like to make a toast...  to Rachel and Joey.
Oy.
And... to love.
Ah, love.
LOVE, love.
L is for life and what is life without love?
Oh my God, are we supposed to answer?
O, is for...   Oh, wow!
The V is for this very surprising turn of events,   which I am still fine with by the way.
E!
is for how extremely normal I find it that you two ...  are together.
And now one day, you might get married   and have children of your own.
Dude, are you okay?
Totally.
Ross, you don't seem okay.
I'm sorry.
It must be the pressure of entertaining.
I think everyone will feel better if we had some flan.
Wait, Ross.
Ross, I, um I, I have to take off.
No!
I'm sorry I have a really early class in the morning.
But this has been lovely.
Wasn't it?
And, and you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that   you never really liked Rachel.
You are on fire!
I'll call you in the morning, okay?
Okay.
/ Alright.
God, Rachel.
What Ross just said is just ....  Oh, that's okay.
Girls tend not to like me.
Okay, I guess it's just flan for three.
Hey, hey, that rhymes.
You know what, Ross?
I think uh, I think we're gonna take off too.
Oh, oh, of course.
God, I'm so stupid.
You guys are a couple now.
I mean you probably just want to be alone.
No, no, it's just getting late....  Hey, hey, hey.
That's fine.
It's totally fine.
We have plenty of margaritas.
It's all good.
I don't even know what that's for.
You know what?
I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
Yeah.
That's probably a good idea.
Yeah, just I'll see you in the morning.
Ahha.
Okay.
Yeah, you know, Joey.
I , I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.
Well, doesn't look good, does it?
It's impossible to find a good doctor.
How do you know the good ones..   from the ones who'll push their penis against your knee?
Excuse me?
I know what she's talking about.
Well, we've gotta find a new pediatrician.
Ross was getting sick last night, and Emma may have caught it.
Why don't you see Dr. Gettleman?
Ross said he died.
He didn't die.
I just saw his daughter last week.
She said he was fine.
Her, on the other hand, botched Botox.
Great.
Well then, I'm gonna take Emma to see him.
I wonder why Ross said that he died?
Maybe he confused him with his childhood therapist.
He saw a therapist?
He used to have a recurring nightmare.
It freaked him out.
Wow, what was it?
That I was going to eat him.
My name's Rachel Greene.
I have an appointment for Emma.
Dr. Gettleman is finishing up with a patient.
He'll be out shortly.
I think you just have a cold.
It's definitely not strep.
Thanks, doctor.
Would you like a lollipop?
Do you even have to ask?
He is alive!
How was the pediatrician?
I really liked him.
Yeah, yeah.
It was really, really, really good.
You promised not to say anything.
I know.
Ross still sees his pediatrician!
I don't care.
Are you serious?
You still see Dr. Gettleman?
He is a brilliant diagnostician!
Diagnostician or booboo fixer?
Seriously, you gotta go to an appropriate doctor.
And not an orthodontist..   not a gynecologist..   and not a veterinarian..   Why?
I know it's a little weird, but he is a great doctor, okay?
He knows my medical history.
And every time I go in there, he makes a big deal.
You know, "Look, it's my favorite patient."
Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your tushy?
I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college.
That was not a security blanket.
That was a wall hanging.
It didn't spend much time on the wall!
I don't mean to be a jerk..   but the baby with the rash came in after me.
The doctor will be right with you, sir.
Mommy, I can't find Waldo.
What page are you on?
What, the circus?
He's behind the elephant.
Wow.
So your child's a big fan of the Waldo books too?
Yeah, that's how I know.
I'm Ross, by the way.
Hi, I'm Sally.
So no ring.
Can I assume you're also a single parent?
I am a single parent.
It's hard, isn't it?
There's no time for a social life.
Where are you gonna meet someone?
Well..  Mommy, I can't..   Sea shore?
Row boat.
Let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office.
Rossie?
We're ready for you.
Yeah..   Come on, Ross Jr.
It's time to go in.
Mommy.
Mommy, what's wrong with that man?
Hey, I helped you find Waldo!
That's it?
Even if nobody helps me,I can eat that.
No problem.
At least give me a challenge.This is Chandler's chicken.
This is the turkey.
Oh.
How big is that?
About 19 pounds.It's like me when I was born.
Who would like some yams?
Will?You'd like that, wouldn't you?
What?
Oh, can we please keepthe chicken..   and the turkey on the other side?
The smell is just..Typical.
What?I said it was typical.
Typical of you.
Queen Rachel doeswhatever she wants in Rachelland.
Seriously, who is this guy?
Sorry, do you have a problem with me?
I don't know.
Do I?
Do I?I think you do.
You were a little meanto him in high school.
A little mean?
You made my life miserable.I had no idea.
I'm sorry.
Well, you should be.Screw it.
Bring on the yams.
But you worked so hard.
Yams!Okay.
I'm real sorry for whateverI did to you in high school.
It wasn't just me.
We had a club.
You had a club?The "I Hate Rachel Greene Club"!
So you all just joined togetherto hate me?
Who else was in this club?Me and Ross.
No need to point.She knows who Ross is.
You were in an "I Hate Rachel" club?Yes, he was.
No, no.
So who else was in this club?That exchange student from Thailand.
But I don't think he knew what it was.
You guys were cool.
So, Ross, we went out for two years..   and you never told me you werein an "I Hate Rachel Club"?
You went out with her?
We had a pact.
It's not like it was binding forever.It had the word "eternity" in it.
I'm thinking of joiningan "I Hate Turkey Club."
Did you know about this?
I didn't.
Is that whyyou used to lock the bedroom door?
Yeah.A little relieved, I gotta say.
Look, Rach, I'm sorry, okay?I was a stupid kid, okay?
The only reason I joined..Cofounded.
Cofounded.
Cofounded the club,was that I was in love with you.
I didn't handle it very well.
If you thinkabout it, the "I Hate Rachel Club"..   was reallythe "I Love Rachel Club."
Except that it was reallythe "I Hate Rachel Club."
Everyone at my school heard it.You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader?
The One with Monica's Thunder Okay, wait, wait, wait.
I just want to say that I love you guys so, so much... ...and thank you for being here on my special night.
Our special night.
It just wouldn't be my night... Our night... ...if you weren't here to celebrate with me...
Us.
Damn it!
It's okay, I want this to be your night too.
To Monica.
Come on, wait, stop it.
Okay, to Monica.
Have you decided on a band for the wedding?
Because I'm kind of musical.
She got engaged a few hours ago, I doubt she's had time to think...
Speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
Yeah, you're on your own.
We should get dressed up and go have champagne at the Plaza.
I can't stay too long.
I gotta get up early for an audition.
I gotta look good.
I'm supposed to be playing a 19yearold.
What?
So when you said get up early, did you mean 1986?
You guys don't think I look 19?
Oh, 19!
We thought you said 90.
Okay, everybody, let's go.
Is my candy bar around here?
No, you ate it all.
I was afraid of that.
You know what shoes would look great with this ring?
Diamond shoes.
You're not getting dressed.
Know what I mean?
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.
There's gonna be a wedding.
You're gonna be the bride.
200 people are gonna be looking at you in a clean, white dress.
Let's do it.
Chandler, it happens to lots of guys.
You're tired, you had a lot of champagne.
Don't worry about it.
I'm not worried.
I'm fascinated.
You know?
It's like biology.
Which is funny, because in high school I failed biology... ...and tonight biology failed me.
'Sup, dude?
Take whatever you want, just don't hurt me.
You playing a little PlayStation, huh?
That's whack.
PlayStation is whack.
'Sup with the whack PlayStation, 'sup?
Come on, am I 19 or what?
Yes, on a scale of one to ten, ten being the dumbest a person can look... ...you are definitely 19.
Come on, really.
How old?
Young.
You're a manchild, okay?
Now get changed, everybody's ready.
And please, please, keep my underwear.
Thanks.
You've had a lot of sex, right?
When, today?
Some, not a lot.
The reason I'm asking is because I had kind of a...
I was unable to...
I really wanted to, but I couldn't...
I cannot believe I'm asking advice from somebody who's wearing that hat.
That happens.
It's happened to you?
Yeah, once.
Well, what'd you do?
I did it anyway.
Phoebe, come on, let's go.
What's wrong with my eyes?
Phoebe, open up.
There's no dog in here.
Well, the hidingthedog plan is off to a great start.
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking.
No, that's just me coughing.
Oh, good.
There you are.
Listen, I have a dog in my room.
What is it doing here?
I'm watching it for friends who went out of town.
Wait.
Hello, my name is Klunkers.
May I please stay with you nice people?
I wish he could stay here, but Chandler's allergic.
Extremely allergic, okay?
If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than five minutes... ...my throat will just close up.
That's odd.
This dog's been living here for the past three days.
Really?
If he's been here that long... ...and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to it.
It still has to go, right?
Why?
Okay, it's...  Don't do it!
Don't do what?
I have to.
Okay?
It's time.
Okay, I hate dogs.
What?!
That's crazy?
Why?
Told you.
They are needy... ...jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking... ...and that scares me a little bit.
You're right.
They are scary.
She just ate a treat out of my hand!
Wait.
Do you not like all dogs?
I mean, not even puppies?
Is there a puppy here?
You don't like puppies?
Okay, you are new.
Look, Chandler, I told you.
Never tell anyone about this dog thing.
It's like Ross not liking ice cream.
You don't like ice cream?
It's too cold!
It's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
Hurts my teeth.
And I don't want you guys to hate me... ...but I don't think I can be around that dog anymore, okay?
So either the dog goes or I go.
Oh, my God!
No, he went for a walk.
Okay, you cannot tell him, but look who's back.
Well, no, no, no.
He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here.
Oh, no, the dog's not going to be there!
You think?
Hi, honey.
Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
What?
Why would...?
Wait and see.
Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Klunkers for you... ...and I left the door open, and she must've gotten out.
And I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof.
Which, FYI, Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed.
I couldn't find him... ...and I am so, so, so sorry.
But I do know where we can all go ease the pain.
We have good news.
Look who's back!
Klunkers.
Oh, my God!
She came back all by herself.
It's a Thanksgiving miracle.
It is so good to see you.
She came all the way back from Ross' building.
The things she must've seen.
She climbed up the fire escape... ...and she tapped on the window with her teeny, little paw, and we ran to let her in.
I went too far, didn't I?
When should I have stopped?
I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David.
She's clearly in love with Mike.
You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.
Phoebe, I have something I want to say.
Oh, God, he's gonna do it.
I cannot watch this.
Let's go.
I think we have time.
Have you heard him talk?
"Phoebe, I would be honored if.." Spit it out, David!
Phoebe.
You're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was unbearable.
Of course, the sanitation strikes in Minsk didn't help.
Sure.
Okay.
Yeah.
But, well, now that we're together again, I don't ever want to be apart.
So to that end..    Oh, my God, Mike.
It's David, actually.
No, Mike's here.
Oh, hey, Mike.
Hi, David.
Chandler.
Monic.. Oh!
It's the humidity!
Hi, Phoebe.
What are you doing here?
I have a question I need to ask you.
I have a question I was kind of gonna ask her myself.
Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this.
Okay.
Would you care for my seat as well?
Actually, yeah, that'd be great.
Well, that's fair, you've had a long trip.
Phoebe, I love you.
I've missed you so much these last few months.
I thought we were apart for a good reason..   but I realized that there was no reason good enough..   to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you.
Kind of steps on the toes of what I was going to say.
I'm sorry, David, but she really has to know this.
All right, but after this, I want to see you outside.
If it stops raining.
You're the most incredible woman I've ever met.
How could I lose you?
Now, I don't actually have a ring.
I have a ring.
I wouldn't brag about that, big guy.
But, Phoebe..   will you marry me?
No.
I love you, but I never needed a proposal from you.
I just needed to know we were headed somewhere.
That we had a future.
We can have any future you want.
Okay, well, I'm gonna take off.
David, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
Just so I know, if I had asked first..?
Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would've been wrong.
Please, you don't have to explain.
I mean, perhaps if I hadn't gone to Minsk..   things would have worked out for us, and I wouldn't have ruined my career.
Or lost that toe to frostbite.
It was a good trip.
Is it okay if I hug you now?
Oh, yes.
Because of our meddling!
Alright, I'm gonna go talk to Joey.
I think this is the right time.
He's always in a good mood  after the flight attendant says "duty free".
Okay, good luck.
Ross's coming over.
I think  now will be a really good time to talk to him.
Oh, oh, I guess so.
I'm just really nervous.
Ok, well, keep in mind that by the time you're done,  they'll probably be serving dinner.
Ooh...
Still nervous?
I'm gonna get the lasagna.
Hey, Rach.
/ Yeah.
Do you... do you mind if I sit here for a sec?
Yeah.
yeah, sure.
Yeah.
Hey.
/ Hey.
So I, um, I kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.
Yeah?
Ok, last night, after you guys broke up,  so sorry to hear about that by the way,  well, Charlie and I were talking and ...well   You kissed.
What?
...What?
What would give you that idea?
I saw you.
Yeah, we kissed  but nothing else nothing else happened, okay?
Ross, Ross, it's okay.
/ What?
It's okay.
I totally understand now you guys make  way more sense than her and I ever did.
You know?
And...
I want you to be happy.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
Now I have something....
I AM speechless!
I mean the fact that you would  put my happiness first like that?
I mean you....you are an incredible friend,  you know that?
Look before you go to...  No, no, I mean it.
I mean you're so , you're so loyal man.
and, and  selfless and generous.
I am those things, yeah.
You know, I've known Chandler longer  so I always think of him as my best friend.
But now...
I may have to rethink some stuff.
Dude!
Hey, if there is ever anything  I can do for you.
I can't think of anything.
Thanks.
/ Yeah.
So hi / Hi  So you, uh,..you talked to Joey.
Oh yeah.
We had a really good talk.
Oh, that's great!
/ Yeah.
Oh so everything's okay?
Oh, no, no.
It's great!
It's great!
He, he's an amazing guy.
Oh,...well, obviously I think so too.
Well, I'm, I'm so excited about this.
Really?
Excited?
Oh, what?
Are you kidding?
I have had some very dirty dreams about this.
Excuse me.
You didn't tell him, did you?
I couldn't.
He was saying  all these really nice things about me.
I didn't want him to get mad  and take'em all back.
I'm gonna edge out Chandler.
/ Oh God!
Alright, fine.
You know what?
Joey, forget it.
When we go back to New York, I will tell him.
Thank you, yeah.
I appreciate that.
She's an FBI agent posing as a beauty contestant
Thanks for the warm welcome.
It's good to have you guys on my team.
I come to play.
I hope you do too.
Let's go out there and get them!
And remember: There is no I in "team."
Yes, but there's two in "martini."
So, everybody, back to my office.
You!
Chuckles.
What's your name?
It's Bing, sir.
I'm sorry.
I was just... No, no.
I heard what you said.
Funny.
I like funny.
This team's about hard work, but it's also about having fun.
Good to have you aboard, Bing!
That's right.
Ryder.
Winona Ryder for six.
Thank you.
Yeah.
We have the reservations.
All right, buddy!
Way to go!
Dude, what are you doing?
Thank you.
My boss keeps slapping my butt and acting like it's no big deal.
What'd you do about it?
I didn't do anything.
I didn't want to be the guy... ...who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
I gotta tell you, I think it's okay to be that guy.
Maybe it's that jock thing.
You know, how football players pat each other after touchdowns.
You know, I don't understand guys.
I mean, I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew... ...by, you know, grabbing her boob.
I know.
For a really great stew, you'd just... ...stick your head in between them.
Read your CompuTek proposal.
Real home run.
Barely got you that time.
Get over here!
Come on.
Oh, yeah!
Good one.
That was a good one.
Keep at it, team!
What is with him?
"With him"?
You're his favorite.
You're his guy!
We never get smacked.
That's not true.
He smacked you once.
Not on purpose.
He ricocheted off you and got me.
I'm telling you, I need some smacks.
I got a kid starting Dartmouth.
Dartmouth?
Who went to Dartmouth?
Dartmouth sucks!
You go to Dartmouth?
And if all goes as planned, my butt will be smackfree.
Fight's over!
Excuse me, Doug?
Hey there, sports fan!
Bing!
You got those numbers for me?
No.
I didn't do them.
You forgot?
No, I just didn't do them.
Instead, I hung out with some friends and had a couple of beers.
So I certainly don't deserve praise.
Verbal... ...or otherwise.
I got tanked myself last night.
Pretty dicey drive home.
Tappan Zee Bridge never looked smaller.
That's okay.
You're still my numberone guy!
Bing!
Doug!
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the way that you express yourself.
Is it the swearing?
Is it the constant swearing?
Because I gotta tell you, if it is, you can just kiss my ass!
It's not about the swearing.
It's more about... ...the way that you occasionally... ...concentrate your enthusiasm... ...on my buttocks.
Don't get me wrong.
I appreciate the sentiment.
It's just that I have a rather sensitive posterior.
And besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.
Well, say no more.
You know, it takes guts to bring this up.
Bing, you're okay.
So, in conclusion, the lines all go up, so I'm happy.
Great job, team!
Tomorrow at 8:30.
Phil, nice job!
Stevens, way to go!
Goldberg, you maniac!
I love you!
Couldn't have done it without you.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, excuse me.
I forgot my briefcase, you know, by accident.
Of course, you did.
Forgot something else too, you bastard!
Well, what about you?
You're not feeling left out, are you?
No, not at all.
That's ridiculous.
Everybody else got one, and you want one too.
Don't you?
Yes, I do.
No!
I was so nervous about that letter.
But the way you owned up to everything... ...it just showed me how much you've grown.
I suppose.
You have, Ross.
You should give yourself credit.
My mom never thought this would work out.
She said, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
I just wish we hadn't lost those four months.
But if time was what you needed to gain a little perspective... We were on a break!
Coffeehouse?
You bet.
It took two people to break up this relationship.
You and that girl, which yesterday you took full responsibility for.
I didn't know what I took responsibility for.
I didn't finish the letter.
I fell asleep.
You fell asleep?
It was 5:30 in the morning.
And you had rambled on for 18 pages.
Front and back!
By the way, YOUapostropheRE means "you are."
YOUR means "your."
I can't believe I thought of getting back with you!
We are so over.
Fine by me!
Those spelling tips will be handy Saturday nights at home... ...playing Scrabble with Monica.
Sorry!
All that sleep you'll miss wishing you were with me!
Don't worry about me falling asleep.
I still have your letter!
Just so you know, it's not that common.
It doesn't happen to every guy.
And it is a big deal!
I knew it!
Gin.
We were playing gin?
If we were a couple, we could play naked.
Would you stop?
Okay.
All right.
All right.
I think you're great.
I think you're sweet and smart... ...and I love you.
But you'll always be the guy who peed on me
Here are your cakes.
We didn't order cake.
No, I know.
They're from me.
You guys, this is not good.
We have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind... ...without taking it from each other.
You're right.
I love you goddesses.
I don't ever want to suck your wind again.
Thank you.
So are we good?
We're good.
We're good?
Let me take these back.
They'll take it out of my paycheck.
Dingdong, the psycho's gone!
Are you sure this time?
I actually saw him leave.
That guy is holding a human head.
He's holding a human head!
Check it out, man!
I tore it off a mannequin in the alley behind Macy's.
There's no alley behind Macy's.
So I got it in the junior miss department.
Big diff.
It'll make a hell of a conversation piece at our next cocktail party.
"Our next cocktail party"?
We'll put chips in it.
We'll make it a chip chick.
Do you remember yesterday?
Yes, I think I vaguely recall it.
Do you remember talking to me yesterday?
So what happened?
We took a road trip to Las Vegas!
Oh, sweet Moses!
So on this road trip, did you win any money?
I crapped out.
But Mr. 21 here!
He cleans up!
$300!
He buys me these new shoes.
Nice.
See you upstairs.
See you, pals!
Is anyone else starting to really like him?
May I help you?
Why doesn't my key work, and what's my stuff doing downstairs?
I'm sorry.
Have we met?
It's Eddie, you freak!
Your roommate.
I'm sorry...
...I already have a roommate.
He's lived here for years.
I don't know what you're talking about.
No, he moved out and I moved in.
Well, I think we'd remember something like that.
I know I would.
That's a good point.
Okay, wow.
I guess I got the wrong apartment.
I'm terribly sorry.
Hey, no problem.
See you.
Goodbye, you fruitdrying psychopath.
You want me to help you unpack?
Nah, I'm okay.
Just so you know, I'm not moving back in because I have to.
I mean, I do have to, but...
It's just that that place, it wasn't really...
I mean, this is...
Welcome home, man.
A little foos?
Absolutely!
What happened to the foosball?
It's a cantaloupe.
Are we gonna bring this out every time Ross comes over?
He paid a lot of money for it.
I'm gonna hold him a different way.
If you hated it so much, why'd you buy it in the first place?
Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing going over there.
But without the other ones, it looks tacky.
Is he housetrained or will he leave little bathroom tiles all over?
Stay.
Stay!
Good fake dog
So beautiful  Oh, I know.
Isn't she?
No, I was talking about your bedding.
Alright.
What's your news, Amy?
Oh.
Well,  I'm getting married.
Wow!
Oh my God!
To who?
This guy...
He has a killer apartment   and....?
And it's on 5th and the elevator opens up  right into the living room.
No, what's...what's he like?
Oh, he's okay.
Do you remember my old boyfriend, Mark?
/ Yeah.
It's his Dad.
Ha!
Well, so he's got to be...  Old?
Yeah.
But he travels a lot so he's hardly ever there.
Pretty, I 've got to tell you it sounds a little bit  like you like the apartment more than you like ...  Myron.
Um, yeah, I told you he was old.
Ugh, sit down.
Sit down.
Oh honey, you know.
I once also almost married somebody  that I didn't love.
Do you remember Barry?
Remember him?
God, we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep.
Sometimes just nodding is okay.
Um , so but anyway, listen.
Not marrying Barry was  the best decision that I ever, ever made.
Honey, Amy, you, you deserve true love  Your, your soul mate is out there somewhere  Someone that is your age that is smart that is fun  and that, that you care about.
You're right.
You're right  I'm going to do it /Okay  I'm going to marry Myron and keep looking for Mr.
Right.
Okay  Okay.
Let's keep talking   Excuse me.
I took your advice.
I left Myron.
Oh, good for you!
/ I know!
I'm Erin Brockovich!
Yes, you are!
Oh, I'm so pround of you / Oh, thank you.
So can I stay with you?
But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
Ah...look who's back.
Why do you have bags?
Rachel, why does she have bags?
I'm staying with you guys.
What?
We're going to be roomies.
Come on.
Slept out here?
Well, Amy kept kicking me in her sleep  yelling "Myron, get off"  But, uh, we're getting rid of her, right?
Rach, please tell me we're getting rid of her.
Joey, I can't do that!
Oh, come on!
Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said  " Whoa, whoa, whoa.
The moment on the lips, forever on the hips"  I don't need that kind of talk in my house.
Joey.
Look, I know that she's difficult.
But I think it's really good that she's here.
Cause we'll appreciate it more when she's gone?
No, it's just ...Look, you know, when I first moved to the city, I was a lot like her.
I was spoiled, selfcentered  and you guys really took care of me.
Yeah, Monica made us.
Well, whatever.
I really appreciate it cause  I don't think I would be the person that I am today  if it wasn't for you guys  So you know, I want to help Amy for you guys helped me  And I know it's going to take patience but that's okay   Good morning / Yeah   Amy, that's what I was supposed to wear today.
That's why I hung it on the door.
Oh, sweetie.
You can't pull this off.
Amy, you know what?
I was thinking that, um, maybe now would be a good time  for us to sit down  and ,uh, you know talk about your future.
Oh, I can't, honey.
I'm going to go get my eyebrow shaped  I am not happy  Oh, sure you want to eat that?
I'm curvy and I like it!

It's not a big deal.
Not a big deal?
It's amazing.
You reach in, there's one little maneuver, and bam!
A bra.
Right out the sleeve.
As far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that comes close.
Right?
Come on!
You guys can pee standing up.
We can?
Okay, I'm trying that.
You know what blows my mind?
Women can see breasts anytime they want.
You just look down, and there they are.
How you get any work done is beyond me.
What I don't get is the way guys can do so many mean things and then not even care.
Multiple orgasms!
The One With the East German Laundry Detergent Saturday night.
The big night!
Date night!
Saturday night.
Saturday night!
No plans, huh?
Not a one!
Not even breaking up with Janice?
Right, right.
Shut up.
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone.
You just gotta do it.
I know.
But it's just so hard.
You're sitting with her.
She has no idea what's happening.
You finally get up the courage to do it.
There's that awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
Why do you have to break up with her?
Be a man.
Just stop calling.
If you want, I'll do it with you.
Thanks, but she'd feel like we were ganging up on her.
You break up with Janice.
I'll break up with Tony.
You're breaking up with Tony?
He's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore.
I don't know if it's me or his hunger strike.
I don't know.
Do you want anything else?
You had a nutty, chocolatey, kind of cakey, pie thing that.
Nothing.
I'm fine.
What's the matter?
Why so scrunchie?
My father wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
That guy, he burns me up.
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home.
It was horrible!
He called me "young lady. "
I hate when my father calls me that.
Did he give you that "You're not up to this" thing again?
I got the extended disco version with choruses of "You'll Never Make it on Your Own. "
Hi, Joey.
Oh, my God!
Fortunately, she has a very pretty face.
I still can't believe this.
My uterus is an inhospitable environment?
I've always tried so hard to be a good hostess.
I can't believe my sperm have low motility.
While I was growing up, they sure seemed to be in a hurry to get places.
Hi there.
Hi.
I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your tests last week..   but I wanted to talk to you about your options.
Okay.
Even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great..   you never know, so keep having sex on a regular basis.
Oh, damn it!
Don't worry.
After a while, you'll tune it out.
Given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success..   would be surrogacy or insemination using a sperm donor.
If you feel that neither of those is right for you, you could always adopt.
Is that a hint?
Because we love you, Dr. Connelly, but we don't want you to be our child.
Wow!
Talk about an inhospitable environment.
I'm gonna take off now.
You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?
Sure you don't want to stay a little longer?
No, I should get home.
I'm kind of tired.
Are you always tired?
Because that could be a sign of clinical depression.
No, it's tiring to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay.
Bye.
I think we found our sperm.
He does seem pretty perfect.
Yeah?
You think so?
Should I ask him?
No.
Why not?
Just because his greatgrandmother was obese?
Our kid's gonna get that from you anyway.
No, that's not it.
It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before..
I just realized I don't care if he is the most perfect guy in the world.
He's not you.
Yeah, he's better!
No, he's not.
If I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by him..   or anyone else.
Really?
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Thank God, because l don't wanna do this either.
I was just doing it because I thought that was what you wanted.
I'm the husband.
I'm supposed to bring the sperm.
That is so sweet.
I love you.
So you know this leaves us with..
Adoption.
How do you feel about that?
I think I feel okay about it.
Actually, I think I feel really good about it.
Me too.
I wanna find a baby that needs a home, and I wanna raise it with you.
And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
So this is it?
We're really gonna adopt?
Yeah.
Oh, my God!
We're gonna be parents!
We are gonna be great parents.
And it could be soon.
I mean, think about it.
Right now, somewhere out there..   our baby could be being conceived.
Wait.
If we're lucky, and we're really, really, really quiet..   we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking.
Hey, Zack.
Hey, Chandler.
I wanted to apologize for last night.
I got the feeling we made you uncomfortable.
No, you didn't.
Really?
No, you did.
My wife and I have some boundary issues.
Sometimes we ask inappropriate questions.
We're working on it.
Here are the boards for Friday's pitch.
Thank you.
You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would you
Smelly cat, smelly cat It's not your fault Smelly, smelly, smelly Really bad smelling smelly cat It's not your fault Smelly cat, smelly cat Oh, my God!
I know.
I sound amazing!
They won't take you to the vet You're obviously not their favorite pet Smelly cat, smelly cat It's not your fault I've never heard myself sing before.
Smelly cat, smelly cat It's not your fault They won't take you to the vet You're obviously not their favorite pet You may not be a bed of roses And you're no friend To those with noses Ross, those are the only lines we have.
Back to the chorus
Come on!
I'll go under, you go over.
Yeah, I'll get right on that.
Come on!
What?
No.
Hey, Rach, come on.
Come on!
I'm sure we won't get arrested for this.
God!
Hi, officer.
Was I going a little too fast?
Oh, my God.
Can I see your license, please?
Absolutely.
It's weird.
I had a dream last night that I was stopped by a policeman.
And then he... Well, I probably shouldn't tell you the rest.
He gave you a big... ...fat... ...ticket?
Your license.
Yes.
Here you go, Officer...
...Handsome.
It's Hanson.
Oops, sorry.
My mistake.
Dear Lord!
Wow!
Here it comes.
This is a great picture.
Really?
You think so?
You know, I had just rolled right out of bed.
You look phenomenal.
She should!
It was taken 10 years ago!
You know, you're probably wondering about the old date.
Yes, I am.
You're an Aquarius, huh?
I'll bet you're a Gemini.
No.
Taurus?
No.
Virgo?
No.
Sagittarius?
Yep.
I knew it.
I knew it!
You won't speed anymore, right?
I won't speed.
And you promise to take care of this?
I promise.
In the meantime, let him drive.
Does he have a license?
Can he handle a stick?
Well...
I can handle a stick!
Remind me to introduce you to someone.
Who?
Fourth gear.
What does he want?
I wasn't doing anything.
Maybe he saw your hands slip briefly from the 10 and 2:00 position.
Maybe it's Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more.
Perhaps he didn't tarnish the badge enough.
It's a different guy.
Good evening, officer.
Do you know how fast you were going?
No, I don't, but it couldn't have been more than 60.
You're right.
It was 37.
Really?
Can I see your license, please?
You're kidding.
You're not gonna give me a ticket for driving too slow, are you?
That's right.
You know, officer...
I had the weirdest dream last night.
Oh, my God!
Your license, please.
You don't want to hear about my dream...
...Officer...
...Pretty?
It's Petty.
I'll be right back with your ticket.
You have a son.
I know.
I know.
$4.50, please.
Thanks for showing up 30 minutes late.
Ross...  no, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse.
What was it, a hair appointment?
A manipedi?
Was there a sale at Barney's?
My father had a heart attack...   while I was at Barney's.
Oh, my god.
Honey...
I'm so sorry.
Is he okay?
Yeah, they said he's going to be fine,  but he's still heavily sedated.
Okay, okay, I'm going to come out to Long Island with you.
I mean, you can't be alone right now.
No, come on, I'm totally okay.
Still, still, let me come... for me.
Okay, if you really need to.
I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.
Oh, I really could.
Great.
This baby better be really good.
Hi.
Excuse me, I'm here to see my father.
My name is Rachel Green.
And I'm Dr. Ross Geller.
Ross, please, this is a hospital, okay.
That actually means something here.
So can we please go in?
Absolutely.
Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here because, uh...  my throat is feeling a little scratchy.
I don't want to infect him.
Ross, please, don't be so scared of him.
I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick.
He's under sedation, so he's pretty much out.
I'm feeling better.
oop    oh, my god.
Oh.
Oh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him  was just money down the drain, huh?
Ms. Green, your father's doctor is on the phone if you'd like to speak to him.
Oh, great.
Are you going to be okay?
He's unconscious.
I think we'll be just fine.
Okay.
um, did... did the TV wake you?
No.
When you put your feet up on my bed,  you tugged on my catheter.
Ouchie.
What are you doing here, Geller?
I came with Rachel,   who should be back any second.
So what's new?
Oh, I had a little heart attack.
Right.
Is it painful?
What, the heart attack,  or sitting here talking to you?
Let's see if we can get that Rachel back in  here.
So what's new with you?
Knocked up any more of my daughters lately?
Nope.
Just the one.
Yeah, sure, right.
I think that kid is wearing a shirt.
You're gonna be fine though.
Hey.
Shh.. Go back to sleep.
I have to go home.
Oh.
This was amazing.
It really was.
You've learned some new moves!
Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me   "Sex for Dummies" as a joke.
Ah.
Who's laughing now?
I know!
How did you sleep?
Good.
You?
Good.
I bet you did!
Uh.
Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
Sure, yeah.
Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?
Chick and the duck?
Didn't they die...
Dive.
Yeah, they dove headfirst  into fun on the farm.
So...Morning.
You too.
Last night was just wonderful.
It really was.
I woke up today with  the biggest smile on my face.
I know, me too.
It was... You know,  it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen,   and then it does,  and it's everything you want it to be.
Uhhuh.
I know.
It was just,     it was just the perfect way  to say goodbye.
There's a nuclear holocaust.
I'm the last man on earth.
Would you go out with me?
I've got canned goods.
Take a look at this!
Check this baby out!
Dug me a hole.
Excellent hole, Joe.
Oh, no!
My hole!
My foot!
What is it?
Jellyfish sting!
It hurts!
Can we help you to the house?
It's two miles.
And I'm tired from digging.
Damn the jellyfish!
Damn all the jellyfish!
Do something.
There's only one thing.
What is it?
Pee on it.
Gross!
I saw it on Discovery Channel.
He's right.
There's ammonia in that... ...that kills the pain.
Forget it.
It doesn't hurt that bad!
You can use my hole for privacy.
Pass the cheese, please.
You can't even look at me, can you?
It's Phoebe!
We can talk to Phoebe!
I'm too depressed to talk.
I'll give you $1000 to talk to us.
What about making that beach trip an annual thing?
What happened out there?
What?
We took a walk.
Nothing happened.
I came back with nothing all over me.
What happened?
Joey?
All right.
We swore we'd never tell.
They'll never understand.
We have to get it out.
It's eating me alive!
Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
All right!
I got stung.
Stung bad.
I couldn't stand.
I couldn't walk.
We were two miles from the house.
We were scared and alone.
We didn't think we could make it.
I was in too much pain.
And I was tired from digging.
Then Joey remembered something.
I'd seen it on Discovery Channel.
Wait, I saw that.
On the Discovery Channel.
About jellyfish and how if you You peed on yourself?
You can't say that!
You don't know!
I thought I would pass out.
I tried, but I couldn't... ...bend that way.
That's right.
I stepped up.
She's my friend and she needed help.
If I had to, I'd pee on any of you.
Only...
...I couldn't.
I got the stage fright.
I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure.
So I turned to Chandler.
Joey kept screaming at me, "Do it now.
Do it.
Do it now!"
Sometimes, late at night, I can still hear the screaming.
Because I do it through my wall to freak you out.
Since you're returning all this stuff... ...you'll have to wear underwear.
All right.
You'd better show me that too.
It's missing something.
Really?
A purse?
It's not a purse.
It's a shoulder bag.
It looks like a woman's purse.
Trust me, all the men are carrying them in the spring catalog.
See, look.
Men carrying the bag.
See, look.
Women carrying the bag.
But it is odd how a woman's purse looks so good on me, a man.
Exactly.
Unisex!
Maybe you need sex.
I had sex a couple days ago.
No, Joey.
UNI sex.
I ain't gonna say no to that!
You look just like your son, Mrs. Tribbiani.
What?
Are you referring to my man's bag?
I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too.
It's got compartments for your wallet, keys, address book...
Your makeup.
What are you doing?
The audition's tomorrow.
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
You get mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
Why would I return this?
I love this bag!
All right, then you owe me $350.
Fine.
Do you take Vasa or Mooster Card?
I'm off to my audition.
How do I look?
Great!
That bag will get you that part.
And a date with a man.
You know what?
Make fun all you want.
This is a great bag.
And it's as handy as it is becoming.
Just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong.
You guys have to get used to the fact that Joey... ...comes with a bag!
I've got to meet my dad.
Will you tell him who you are?
Not at first.
I don't want to freak him out.
But aren't you pissed at him?
This guy abandoned you.
If it were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger.
I'd walk in there, I'd be like, "Yo, Dad!
You and me, outside.
Right now!"
I kind of scared myself.
Well, at least you scared someone.
You'd think I'd be angry.
You'd think I'd want to rip his tiny, little head off!
Fortunately, I'm past it.
How'd the audition go?
Estelle said I didn't get it.
What?
Why?
Joey, you were so ready for it.
I thought so too... ...but the casting people had problems with me.
What kind of problem?
To tell you the truth... ...they had a problem with the bag!
You know what?
It was a stupid play anyway.
It's time to give up the bag.
I don't want to give up the bag.
I don't have to give it up.
Do I, Rach?
You think I should give up the bag!
Joey, I'm sorry.
As terrific as I think you are with it...
...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
I can't believe this!
Wait, I'm not saying you shouldn't have a bag.
There are other bags that are maybe a little less... ...controversial.
Yeah, they're called wallets.
Come on in.
I was going to.
I brought some wine.
Would you like some?
Sure.
So here we are.
Nervous?
Me?
No.
You?
I want this to happen.
So do I. I'm going to put on some music.
Joey likes to scare the duck.
Maybe I'll dance for you.
You look good.
Thanks.
You know, when you say things like that, it makes me... ...want to rip that sweater vest right off.
Why don't we move into the bedroom?
Really?
Do you not want to?
First I want to take off all my clothes... ...and have you rub lotion on me.
That would be nice.
I'll go get the lotion.
It's way out of hand.
She wants me to put lotion on her!
She's bluffing!
She's not backing down.
She went like this He's not backing down.
He went to get lotion.
It's Chandler.
You can take him.
Come on.
Don't you remember when you made him cry using only your words?
Aren't you guys done yet?
I want to sit in my chair!
The sooner Phoebe breaks him, the sooner it's over and out in the open.
I like that.
Show him your bra.
He's afraid of bras.
Can't work them.
You didn't rip off any buttons.
It's not my first time.
Go back there and seduce her till she cracks!
Give me a second.
Did you clean up in here?
Of course!
You're going?
Not without you, lover.
So this is my bra.
It's very, very nice.
Well, come here.
I'm very happy we're going to have all the sex.
You should be.
I'm very bendy.
I'll kiss you now.
Not if I kiss you first.
I guess there's nothing left for us to do but kiss.
Here it comes.
Our first kiss.
You win!
I can't have sex with you!
And why not?
I'm in love with Monica!
You're what?
Love her!
I love her!
I love you, Monica.
I love you too, Chandler.
I thought you were doing it.
I didn't know you were in love!
Dude!
Hats off to Phoebe.
Quite a competitor.
May I say your breasts are still showing.
God.
All right!
So that's it?
It's over.
Everybody knows!
Actually, Ross doesn't.
We'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Well, here it is.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I'm so sorry.
Have you been here long?
That's okay.
What the hell took you so long?
You can't tell Chandler.
I ran into Richard.
Which Richard?
The Richard.
Richard Simmons?
Oh, my God!
No, my exboyfriend Richard.
You know, the tall guy, mustache.
Okay, that actually makes more sense.
How was it?
It was really nice.
We talked and I had lunch with him.
That's weird.
I dreamed you had lunch with Richard.
Really?
Again, Richard Simmons.
Go on.
The strange part was he was really nice... ...and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything.
So why can't we tell Chandler?
It'll freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary.
I don't wanna spoil it.
I can't believe you guys have lasted a whole year!
Wow, I owe Rachel 20 bucks.
On a totally different bet.
It's almost our anniversary!
I know.
One year ago today, I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
I got you a gift.
It's not till tomorrow.
I know, but you have to open it today.
Okay!
It'll be perfect.
You'll see Joey, plus, we'll start our celebration on the plane.
We can call it our "Planeaversary."
Do we have to?
This is great, but Joey didn't want any of us there.
He doesn't want us to go to any trouble.
He'll be excited when we surprise him.
Plus, we get to have our own "AnnaVegasry"!
"Annavadaversary!"
I think we should see other people.
We can go, right?
Great idea.
I'm gonna go too!
Phoebe, it's kind of our anniversary.
You won't ditch me like you did with London.
Ditch you?
You were pregnant Great story.
I'm going.
Listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey!
So far, is this trip to Las Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
So far, it's pretty much the same, Phoebe.
What about after I give you these candies?
I guess it's a little better now.
Las Vegas, 1.
Can I give you your present now?
Okay!
Oh, don't tell me I did this.
I love "I forgot the present" fakeout!
How about "I did forget the present, forgive me" not fakeout?
You can give it to me when we get back.
This is the worst thing that could happen.
You decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
What "Richard thing"?
Oh, no.
What "Richard thing"?
Simmons.
Go with Simmons.
I ran into Richard yesterday.
He asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did.
I didn't tell you because you'd get mad... ...and I didn't wanna spoil our anniversary.
I'm not mad.
Really?
So you bumped into Richard.
You grabbed a "bite."
No big deal.
Great.
Okay, London, 1.
He was playing blackjack for an hour and he won $5000.
Are you going to go out again?
I don't know.
He hasn't called since we went out.
I see him in the hallway.
We flirt.
I'm all: And then nothing.
Wow, thirsty.
I'm having a party on Saturday.
Sort of a housewarming thing.
Fun.
Great!
I'm looking forward to it.
See you!
So I guess we won't be warming his house.
All right, I see what he's doing.
He's not asking me out because he wants me to ask him out.
And you won't do that.
That's right!
Because that would give him the control.
So now he comes up with this "I've got a party" thing... ...to get me to hint for an invitation.
Blew up in his face, didn't it?
So there is no party?
No, there's a party.
There's a party.
But the power?
That is still up for grabs.
You follow me?
I think so.
So he won't invite you to his party because he likes you?
Exactly!
Then why didn't he invite me?
Thanks, I'll try to stop by.
Actually, I think I'm going to be busy.
You are?
Remember, I've got that gala?
What's the gala for?
It's a regatta gala.
Do you sail?
No, but I support it.
I hope I see you tomorrow night.
Take care.
Walked right into that one, didn't he?
What one?
You wanted him to invite you and he did.
He waited until the last minute.
So if I said yes... ...he'd know I had nothing better to do than wait for his invitation.
But I said no... ...which puts me back in the driver's seat.
So the ball is in his court?
Ball?
No, there's no ball.
Don't let him in!
I'm supposed to be at a gala.
We'll be right there.
I have to go downstairs and back up, as if I'm coming home from the gala.
So just go distract him.
But don't be sexy.
What's going on?
This is a great party.
Great food.
You know, most parties, it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa.
So... What's this?
Salad.
And what's this?
Bread.
Aren't you a chef?
Right, tonight was your party.
You look great!
I'm glad you made it.
Well, you know, the gala had to end sometime.
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.
Whose court is the ball in now?
I thought there wasn't a ball.
Come on.
He's glad I came.
He doesn't want me to go anywhere.
Ball's flying all over the place.
This is my friend, Tom.
This is the girl I told you about.
Come on!
You telling people about me?
I think you two could really hit it off.
I'm gonna go mingle.
So you work at Bloomingdale's?
My mom calls it "Bloomies."
At ease, soldier!
I'm sorry?
You can just drop the act.
I know what's going on.
You're Danny's wingman, right?
You guys are best buds, frat bros.
I'm going to go talk to a friend.
Yeah, you go talk to your friend.
Go tell him, "Nice try."
He just keeps lobbing them up... ...and I keep knocking them right out of the park.
You don't need me taking up all your space.
Okay..   Oh, I'm sorry, I think..
I think that may have missed the table.
Oh, do you?
Yeah.
Do you?
Yeah.
Do you?
Yeah!
You really find this attractive on him?
Oh, yeah.
Are you telling me you're not even a little turned on by Monica right now?
This is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.
All right, come on, Mike.
You can beat her.
Knock that dog off her head.
Damn it!
I sleep with him!
Game point.
Don't get too cocky.
Remember, I won the last one.
Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?
You should look in the mirror before you call yourself that.
No!
No!
No!
And that's how it's done.
Okeydokey.
You've each won a game, and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life.
Everybody goes home a winner.
Best of three?
That's what I'm thinking.
Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
Serve the ball, chump.
"Serve the ball, chump."
Okay, better comebacks, Mike.
Better comebacks.
Okay, so it's tied again, 41 to 41.
Okay, look, enough is enough.
No.
I just have two more points to beat him.
Monica, that was also true an hour ago!
I mean, please, look at you.
Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable!
Phoebe, talk to Mike.
Help me out.
Mike, you win this, you will get the best sex you've ever had in your whole life.
You've already proven you're just as good as he is.
We missed our dinner reservations, so let's just go upstairs..   order room service, take a shower and shave your head!
I can't just walk away.
I've put in four hours.
You knew this about me when you married me.
You agreed to take me in sickness and in health.
Well, this is my sickness!
What about the obsessive cleaning?
That's just good sense.
You okay?
No, honey, I'm okay.
Shake it off.
Oh, no shaking.
No shaking.
No shaking.
Oh, my God.
I can't play.
So you forfeit?
Mike wins?
I can't believe it.
I lost.
No, you didn't.
What?
Because I'm gonna play for you.
You can't do that.
It's okay.
I don't care which of them I beat.
Okay, we're taking that paddle home, mister.
Honey, you don't have to do this.
Yes, I do.
I may not understand why you have to win so badly..   but if it's important to you, it's important to me.
Because I love you.
But you suck.
You're welcome, sweetheart.
All right, let's get this over with.
Sudden death.
Whoever wins this point, wins.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
You're good.
It's like watching porn.
That was so amazing.
Well, when did you..?
Hold on, I almost forgot.
Loser.
When did you stop sucking?
I never sucked.
I just didn't want you..    to know how good I was.
Why?
I don't know.
Well, this is so great.
Now we can enter doubles tournaments.
That's why.
I mean..   What
The sound Mom and Dad will never forget.
For this, after all, is the miracle of birth.
Lights, please.
And that's having a baby.
Next week is our final class.
Susan, go deep.
It's impossible.
It's just impossible.
What is, honey?
What that woman did.
I am not doing that!
It'll have to stay in, that's all.
Everything will be the same.
It'll just stay in.
Carol, honey.
Everything will be all right.
What do you know?
No one's saying to you, "Hi, is that your nostril?
Carol, sweetie.
Cleansing breath.
I know it's frightening.
But big picture: The birth part is just one day and when it's over, we'll all be parents for the rest of our lives.
I mean, that's what this is all about, right?
Ross?
Ross.
I'm gonna be a father.
This is just occurring to you?
I knew I was having a baby.
I just never realized the baby was having me.
You're gonna be great.
How could you say that?
I can't even get Marcel to stop eating the bathmat.
How will I raise a kid?
You know, some scientists are now saying that monkeys and babies are actually different.
Where are you going?
Out.
With?
Can I just ask you one question?
Have you two, you know, like, you know?
You know?
Yet?
Not that it's any of your business but no, we haven't.
You meant sex, right?
Do you have a sec?
Okay, I think I get how to do this.
Can we turn this off?
Can we make them go away?
Because I can't watch.
They're gone.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
It's just this whole stupid Ursula thing.
Okay, can I ask?
So he's going out with her.
Is it really so terrible?
Yeah.
I mean, I'm not saying she's evil or anything.
She's just, you know, always breaking my stuff.
When I was 8, I wouldn't let her have my Judy Jetson thermos so she threw it under the bus.
And then there's Randy Brown who was like.
Have you ever had a boyfriend who was your best friend?
Well, but that's what he was for me.
And she, you know, kind of stole him away and then broke his heart.
And then he wouldn't even talk to me anymore.
He didn't want to be around anything that looked like either one of us.
I mean, I know Joey's not my boyfriend or my thermos or anything, but.
You won't lose him.
You gotta talk to Joey.
Yeah, okay.
He doesn't know this stuff.
If he knew how you felt.
He's falling in love with her.
They've been going out a week.
They haven't even slept together yet.
I mean, that's not serious.
May we help you?
You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
That's what it seemed like.
I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.
Fine, then why didn't you say something?
Because it is too damn hard Ross.
I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you.
When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go...
Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you  because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else,  you're wrong.
It's because you mean more to me.
So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!
Rach!
What?
You keep, you keep... You can't...  WHAT?
All right, here it goes...
Doesn't work..
I can't take You don't have to do anything.
Just don't tell them we know.
I can't take anymore secrets.
I got your secrets, their secrets, secrets of my own.
You don't have any secrets.
Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
How are we going to mess with them?
You could use your position as the roommate.
And I would use the strongest tool at my disposal.
My sexuality.
Hello, children.
Watch.
Learn.
And don't eat my cookie.
That jacket looks great on you.
Really?
The material is so soft.
Hello, Mr. Bicep.
You're working out?
I try to squeeze things.
Are you okay?
If you really want to know I can't tell you this.
You can tell me anything.
Actually, you are the one person I can't tell this to.
And the one person I want to the most.
What's going on?
I just haven't been with a guy in so long... ...and sometimes you're looking for something... ...and it's right there in front of you, sipping coffee... Oh, no.
Have I said too much?
Just something to think about.
I know I will.
You are so cute.
How did you get to be so cute?
My grandfather was Swedish.
And my grandmother was a tiny little bunny.
Now you're even cuter.
You know, that is a popular opinion today, I must say.
The weirdest thing happened at the coffeehouse.
Phoebe was hitting on me.
What are you talking about?
I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
It's not possible.
I'm sorry, Phoebe's just always thought you were charming... ...in a sexless kind of way.
You know, I can't hear that enough.
I just think you misunderstood her.
I didn't, okay?
She was all over me.
She touched my bicep, for crying out loud.
This bicep?
Well, it's not flexed right now.
Why is it so hard for you to believe that Phoebe could be attracted to me?
Bye, Chandler.
I miss you already.
Did you see that?
The inappropriate, and the pinching?
Actually, I did.
So do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Oh, my God!
She knows about us!
Are you serious?
She knows, and she's trying to freak us out!
That's the only explanation!
But what about my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps?
She knows!
Phoebe knows about us.
I didn't tell them!
Them?
Who's "them"?
Phoebe and Joey.
And Rachel.
I would have told you, but I promised not to tell.
I'm sorry.
But it's over now, right?
You can tell them you know they know, and I can go back to knowing nothing!
Unless Not "unless"!
This must end now!
They think they are so slick messing with us.
But they don't know that we know that they know.
They don't know that we know they know we know.
I am that, and the whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
The essence of the character is rooted in her confidence.
So when Jessica enters a room, for instance... ...she owns everything... ...and every person in that room.
You try it.
Okay.
All right!
No.
He's not angry at the room either.
Try it again.
He owns it.
He owns the room.
It is his.
He owns, owns, owns the room!
He owns it!
It's a little weird, but it's getting better.
I'm gonna miss this woman so much.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
It's been 20 years of my life.
Hey, hey.
Maybe this is a good thing.
It'll give you a chance to shake things up.
Play different characters.
You're so talented.
I am, I am.
But I don't know.
Probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in... ...but I just got so comfy here and...
I turned down some amazing work.
Like what?
Well, let's just say if I'd left 15 years ago... ...the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today.
Wow.
But, well, now... Now's a different time for me.
Oh, hey, come on.
Don't do this.
Let me tell you something, okay?
When I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, "Boy, she is a great actress."
But I'm also thinking, "She is hot."
You think I'm hot?
You own the room.
We should probably get the... Oh, yeah.
Yeah, we should get...
So when Jessica kisses a man... ...she usually puts... ...both her hands on the man's face.
I notice that.
Is that because she's so passionate?
No, it's because that way the camera only sees her.
You want to try it?
Yeah, okay.
That was good.
That was really good.
But I think that maybe your hands are just a little off.
They should be right... Hey, hey!
Oh, that'd be me, sir.
After you.
Oh, thank you.
Nice.
Well, you certainly own that room.
Actually, I rent the whole place.
I just got what you meant.
Thank you.
Hi.
Hey.
Oh, my God.
Oh, Jessica Lockhart!
In my apartment!
I am such a huge fan.
I am such a huge fan.
It's nice to know... Monica!
That's my roommate, Rachel.
That explains all the women's underwear.
Can I just ask you to do me just one favor?
Certainly.
Would you slap me right here in the face?
I'd love to, but my lawyer said I can't do that anymore.
God, you seem really, really nice.
All right, here we go.
No, wait.
Just one more thing.
You're a stupid bitch.
I really can't slap you.
You are so beautiful.
So nice to meet you.
My God, you're great.
Thanks for stopping by.
I am so sorry about that.
Oh, no.
Being adored, I'm used to it.
Don't worry about it.
Oh, my God.
What?
They sent me today's script.
They never send me the script.
They don't?
I'm just in a coma.
This must mean I have lines.
How does it happen?
You get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
A what?
Jessica hates horses.
After this, she's not gonna be crazy about electricity either.
Now, remember, you have to imagine me in a kilt.
p { fontfamily: sansserif; textalign: center; } .KRCC { Name: Korean; lang: koKR; } > Chandler!
Chandler!
I saw what you were doing in the window!
I saw what you're doing to my sister!
Get out here!
Listen, we had a good run.
What was it?
Four, five months?
That's more than most people have in a lifetime.
Goodbye.
What are you doing?
I am going on the lam.
Come on, Chandler.
I can handle Ross.
Hold on!
Hey, Ross.
What's up, bro?
What the hell are you doing?
What's going on?
I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Dude, he's right there.
I thought you were my best friend!
This is my sister!
My best friend and my sister!
I cannot believe this!
We're not just messing around.
I love her.
I'm in love with her.
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way.
I'm sorry, but it's true.
I love him too.
My best friend and my sister!
I cannot believe this!
You guys want to probably get some hugs in too.
Big news!
We've actually known for a while.
What?
You guys knew?
You all knew and you didn't tell me?
We were worried about you.
We didn't know how you were going to react.
You were worried about me?
You didn't know how I'd react?
Okay.
All right.
Let's clear out of here and let these lovebirds get back to business.
Or you would have seen a Chandlershaped hole in that door.
What's the matter?
Rachel and I had a big fight.
Can I come in?
I know we're not supposed to see each other anymore.
I don't know anybody in this city and I need somebody to talk to.
Sure.
What happened?
I don't want to talk about it.
Okay.
You know what might cheer me up?
What?
Seeing some more of your super cool slides.
Wow, really?
Totally.
I loved them.
You could finish telling me about the different kinds of sand.
I'd love to.
Wait right here, I'll go get the projector and my notes.
Thanks.
You're such a good friend.
Have you guys seen Jill?
I can't find her.
The slides are almost ready.
Yeah.
I know what this is missing: Alcohol.
There's wine in the kitchen.
Oh, great.
What is my sister doing there, and why are the drapes shut?
Okay.
Rach, calm down, okay?
She's really upset.
We're just talking.
She's making something happen with you to get back at me.
That's the only reason she could be here, huh?
It couldn't be that maybe I'm a good listener... and I put on a great slide show?
Ross, I am telling you, she is using you to get back at me.
I think I can take care of myself.
I'll talk to you later.
Goodbye.
That was your sister, actually.
She thinks you're just using me.
So?
Hey.
Hey.
You may have been right about Jill.
I knew it!
What happened?
She kissed me.
What?
You kissed?
Maybe we should give them some privacy... Look, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
Doesn't sound like it.
It's easy not to kiss someone.
You just don't.
Look at us right now, not kissing!
Let me finish, okay?
She started kissing me... and I didn't stop it.
I guess I just wasn't thinking.
Yeah.
Let me give you something to think about.
Hold on!
But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth to tell me that.
I realized if anything happened with me and Jill... then nothing could ever happen with us.
What?
No, I mean...
I don't know if anything is ever going to happen with us... again, ever.
But I don't want to know that it never could.
So I stopped it... and she got mad and broke my projector.
Wow.
I don't even know what to say.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
My God, are you crying?
I just don't see why those two can't work things out!
All right, I'm leaving.
I'm not spending one more day with someone who's out to sabotage me.
That's you, Rachel.
Yeah, I got that.
And you!
I throw myself at you... and you say no?
How gay are you?
You take care, Jill.
Okay, see you.
Byebye.
I can't believe Jill's gone.
I can't help it, I opened a gate
We leave tomorrow, and you still have a lot to pack.
You're right.
Maybe I shouldn't go.
What?
So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javu?
But it's just a little outside of Tulsa.
Well, how far outside?
Manhattan?
And you're thinking of taking it?
Before, you said that being with me was more important than any job.
But I guess now it's old job, me, new job.
I'm gonna miss this hand!
I know this is a lot to ask..   but, my God, this is a onceinalifetime opportunity.
What happened to "you can't live without me four days a week"?
Well, if you really think about it, I mean, four days is not that long.
I see you Monday before you go to work..   and Thursday when you get back..   and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it..   it's really just one day.
And well, if we can't make it one day, we got real problems, my friend.
I think you should take the job.
Really?
I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.
That's the nicest thing anybody's ever said to me.
Good, you haven't left yet.
Where have you been?
I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office.
There was some guy that freaked everybody out.
I don't think I'm going back there.
You got here just in time.
I really have to go, buddy.
Oh, man.
Promise to call me when you land?
Of course I will.
I love you.
I love you too.
Watch the tongue, people.
We got a baby over here.
Bye, Chandler.
Bye.
Bye, honey.
Bye.
What's the matter, Joe?
I'm mad at you for leaving.
You know, you're nothing but a big leaver.
A big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
Any chance you're trying to pick a fight to make all of this easier?
Dude, you see right through me!
Okay, well.. Bye, Mon.
Bye, Ross.
Rachel.
Bye, Emma.
Okay, byebye.
Have a good trip.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
Wait.
It goes old job..   new job..   and you.
This is just something I have to do.
I know.
I love you so much.
I know that too.
Don't worry.
I'll be back before you know it.
Yes, it will be the same.
Because I know, that's how.
I promise.
You double promise?
Call me when you land.
Can I talk now?
Okay, bye.
Joey!
He had to board
I don't care.
There's Lorraine.
Now, remember, no trading.
You get the pretty one.
I get the mess.
Well, well!
Look what you brought!
Very nice.
And what did you bring?
She's checking her coat.
I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off of my hands.
Will you get me a white zinfandel and a glass of red for Janice?
Janice?
Oh my God!
Hey, it's Janice!
You know ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
Yeah?
Good for you.
Quarters or rolls of quarters?
By the way, Chandler, I cut you out of all of my pictures.
So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
That's okay.
Are you sure?
Because you could make little puppets out of them.
And you could use them in your Theater of Cruelty!
We can't do that!
What?
What can't you do?
Can I talk to you for a second?
Over there?
We might be leaving now.
Say it's you and me "we. "
She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off.
I'm not even sure what slathering is!
But I definitely want to be a part of it!
Okay, you cannot do this to me.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
Can we have three chocolate mousses to go, please?
I'm out of here.
Here's my credit card.
Dinner's on me.
I'm sorry.
I hope she throws up on you.
Thanks.
So.
Just us.
What a crappy night!
Though I've enjoyed the fact that your shirt's been sticking out of your zipper since you came back from the bathroom.
Excuse me.
How you doing?
So do we have the best friends, or what?
Joey's not a friend.
He's a stupid man who left us his credit card.
Another drink?
Some dessert?
A bigscreen TV?
I will go for that drink.
You got it.
Good woman!
A bottle of your most overpriced champagne.
Each.
That's right.
Each.
And a rob roy.
I've always wanted to know.
Oh, my God!
And I just want a million dollars!
Rachel?
Oh, God, Monica!
Hi!
Thank God!
I went to your building and this guy with a hammer said that you might be here and you are.
Can I get you some coffee?
Decaf.
Everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.
This is everybody.
Chandler and Phoebe and Joey.
And remember my brother, Ross?
Sure!
You want to tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
Oh, God!
Well, it started about a halfhour before the wedding.
I was in this room with all the presents and I was looking at this gravy boat.
This really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.
When all of a sudden I realize.
Sweet 'N Low?
I realized I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry.
And then I really freaked out, when it hit me: How much Barry looks like Mr.
Potato Head.
I always knew he looked familiar, but I had to get out of there, and I started wondering "Why am I doing this?"
and "Who am I doing this for?"
I didn't know where to go, and I know you and I have drifted apart but you're the only person I know in the city.
Who wasn't asked to the wedding.
I was kind of hoping that wouldn't be an issue.
I guess he bought her the pipe organ and she's really not happy about it.
"Tuna or egg salad?"
Daddy, I just.
I can't marry him.
I'm sorry.
I just don't love him.
Well, it matters to me!
She should not be wearing those pants.
I say push her down the stairs!
Push her down the stairs!
Push her down the stairs!
Come on, Daddy, listen!
All my life, everyone's always told me, "You're a shoe! "
"You're a shoe!
You're a shoe!
You're a shoe! "
I stopped and said, "What if I don't wanna be a shoe?
What if I want to be a purse?
Or a hat?"
I don't want you to buy me a hat, I.
It's a metaphor, Daddy!
You can see where he'd have trouble.
Look, Daddy, it's my life.
Well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
I guess we've established she's staying with Monica.
Well, maybe that's my decision.
Well, maybe I don't need your money.
Wait!
Wait!
I said maybe!
Just breathe.
Breathe, that's it.
Just try to think of nice, calm things.
Raindrops on roses And whiskers on kittens Doorbells and sleigh bells And something with mittens La la la something And noodles with string These are a. I'm all better now.
I helped.
This is probably for the best, you know?
Independence.
Taking control of your life.
The whole "hat" thing.
If you need anything, you can always come to Joey.
Me and Chandler live across the hall.
And he's away a lot.
Joey, stop hitting on her!
It's her wedding day.
What?
Like there's a rule or something?
"You ready to jump out of the plane without a chute?"
I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy.
They printed it.
I didn't know they print jokes.
They print jokes, interviews, hardhitting journalism.
It's not just about the pictures.
Didn't work on Mom, it's not gonna work on us.
Check it out.
It's the first one.
Right there.
That is funny.
It was also funny when I made it up.
What?
I made that joke up.
No, you didn't.
I did.
Yes, I did.
I told Dan and he said it was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.
Hey, tell Dan thanks.
What?
I was just reading the joke below it.
Man, that one is funny.
Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
No.
Seriously?
You tell a lot of jokes.
Look, it's my joke.
But if it makes you feel better, they don't print the name.
So it doesn't really matter who gets credit.
Yeah, I guess.
Hey, guys.
Playboy printed my joke!
No, it's mine!
Call them!
They'll tell you!
My joke!
My joke!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Jokes?
What...?
You know there's naked chicks in there, right?
And put on your apron.
Okay.
I don't see you asking other paying customers to put on aprons.
I don't think we're gonna settle this.
Let's have Monica decide.
Hey, Mon!
Get out here!
Monica?
Okay.
You have to decide whose joke this is.
Why do I have to?
You're the only one that can be fair.
I can't be.
You're my boyfriend.
But I'm your brother.
We're family.
That's the most important thing in the world.
Don't try to sway her.
I'm your only chance to have a baby.
Okay, let's go.
All right.
We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke... then you decide which one of us is telling the truth.
Me.
Chandler, you first.
I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
Did I meet him at Christmas?
Can I finish?
You want me to pick you?
See, I would never snap at you like that.
Two babies.
Continue.
Okay.
Steve said he had to go to the doctor.
And his doctor's name is Dr. Mompey.
I said, "Dr.
Monkey?"
And that is how the whole Dr. Monkey thing came up.
Are you kidding?
Okay, look, I study evolution.
Remember?
Evolution.
Monkey into man.
Plus, I'm a doctor.
And...
I had a monkey.
I'm Dr. Monkey!
I'm not arguing with that.
I've heard enough for my decision.
Okay, so what..?
Do tell.
You are both idiots.
It's not funny.
And it's offensive to women.
And doctors.
And monkeys.
You shouldn't argue over who gets credit.
You should argue over who gets blamed for inflicting this joke on the world.
Now, let it go.
The joke sucks.
It's your joke.
It is not.
Why don't you tell them... what you told me about me not being high maintenance.
Monica is a selfsufficient, together lady.
You guys, I want you to meet Sebastian.
We met at the newsstand.
We both grabbed for the last Field and Stream.
What?
I read that.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
Yes.
Thank you.
Rachel, what the hell is this?
What?
You ask us to find a guy, and you come traipsing in here with a guy of your own?
You found me a guy?
Yes.
We found you a really cute, funny guy from Chandler's work.
Yeah, and I found you one too, who is not a weirdo.
You know what though, guys, I really appreciate that... but I'm gonna take Sebastian.
Are you sure?
Our guy smells incredible.
Would you stop it with that already?
Here you go.
Thank you.
So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
Not really.
Why?
No reason.
I know a single guy who does care about other people.
Are you funny?
Excuse me?
What are you guys doing?
Are you funny?
Tell us a joke!
I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
Well, so do a lot of people.
Actually, I gotta get going.
But you.. Give me a call sometime.
You didn't give me your phone number.
Okay, see you later.
Turns out he is kind of funny.
I cannot believe you guys!
He was really nice, and he just left because of you!
Yeah, but "Sebastian"?
What is that, a cat's name?
You know what I noticed, Rachel?
He scares easy.
Is that the kind of guy you wanna take to a ball?
"Hey, Sebastian, would you like to dance?"
"Okay.
I gotta go."
Stop it.
Rachel, we're very sorry.
That is a very insensitive thing to do.
Let us make it up to you.
We have two really great guys for you.
Yeah, what have you got to lose?
You might even end up with someone really special.
If you pick my guy.
All right.
So you will meet our guys?
Yes.
Okay, good.
Hey.
Hi.
We're so glad you decided to meet our guy.
You'll like him so much.
When do you want to meet him?
I don't know.
I don't work late tomorrow night.
Tomorrow night is good.
But why put off something till tomorrow that you could do it right now?
Eldad, come here!
What?
This is Rachel.
How are you?
A little blindsided but good.
Eldad, sit down.
Move over now.
There you go.
There you are.
Okay, we can take a hint!
What?
What are you doing here?
This is Patrick.
Hi.
Hi.
You're too late because she's already with our guy.
You're right, I am too late.
They're sitting on the couch and talking.
Come on.
Rachel?
This is Patrick.
Hi.
Hi.
This is the guy I was telling you about.
This suit does not do justice to what's underneath it.
Okay.
But, Phoebe, I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
Okay.
That's okay.
Have a seat.
You can't do that!
I should go.
Sit down, we're winning.
Maybe I should go.
No.
Have a seat!
Rachel, you haven't touched Eldad's hair.
He has the softest hair.
Touch it.
I'm good.
Rachel, Patrick is really rich.
Give her some money.
This isn't really worth the free massage.
That's right.
Byebye.
No.
Eldad is much more cooperative, and he can dance.
You dance for Rachel.
Don't dance for me.
Please!
What is the matter with you?
Yeah, let's talk it out.
Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
I'm a little embarrassed.
I'll tell you who should be embarrassed.
It's you guys.
I do not need you to get me a date.
Why did she ask us to..?
I am still talking!
Then you chase away the one guy I actually liked.
No offense to you guys.
Really, congratulations on... all the cash.
And you really do have very soft hair.
But I'd much rather go to the ball by myself than go through any more of this.
Goodbye.
Now, do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?
Papaya extract.
Thank you.
I still don't know.
I want to make sure I bought the right couch, one that says... ..."Kids welcome here," but that also says... ..."Come here to me."
What?
You say that to kids?
The "Come here to me" is, you know, for the ladies.
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch, it's not a magic couch.
Well, you picked a great couch.
Sign here, please.
Sure.
The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
That's ridiculous.
All right, Rach, come on.
Let's go.
Are you kidding?
Come on.
It's only three blocks.
It's not very heavy.
Try it.
Oh, I can do it.
You two will really enjoy that couch.
We're not together.
Something didn't quite add up there.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, you.
Her.
I mean, she's very... ...you know.
And you're, like... ...you know?
Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
Really?
You two?
I don't want to do this now.
I'm carrying a heavy couch.
Then tell him quickly.
Fine.
We went out.
Not only did we go out... ...we did it 298 times!
You kept count?
You are such a loser!
A loser you did it with 298 times!
Come here to me.
No, no.
You come here to me.
I brought reinforcements.
Great!
You brought Joey?
The next best thing.
You brought Chandler?
The next best thing would be Monica!
I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so...
I drew a sketch of how we'll do it.
Rach, that's you.
That's the couch.
What's that?
That's me.
Certainly think a lot of yourself.
No.
That's my arm.
I see.
I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
Just follow my lead.
Come on, Chandler.
All right.
Okay.
Here we go.
All right.
Ready?
Turn!
I don't think we can turn any more!
I don't think it'll fit!
Yeah, it will.
Come on!
Up, up, up!
Up!
Yes!
Here we go!
Pivot!
Pivot!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
I don't think it'll pivot any more.
You think?
All right, let's bring it back down and try again.
I think it's really stuck now.
I can't believe that didn't work.
I know.
Me neither.
I mean, you had a sketch.
What did you mean when you said "pivot"?
Yeah, because it's not 1985.
Oh, my God!
It's true.
Who am I?
Monica, you're Mom.
Oh, my God!
Okay, I'll be there.
That was my agent.
My agent has just gotten me a job in the new Al Pacino movie!
That's great!
What's the part?
Can you believe this?
Al Pacino!
This guy's why I became an actor.
"I'm out of order?
You're out of order!
This whole courtroom's out of order! "
Seriously, what's the part?
"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in! "
Come on.
Seriously, Joey, what's the part?
You're, you're,  What?
I'm his butt double, okay?
I play Al Pacino's butt.
All right?
He goes into the shower, and then I'm his butt.
Oh, my God!
Come on, you guys.
This is a real movie and Al Pacino's in it and that's big!
Oh, no, it's terrific.
After all your years of struggling you've finally been able to crack your way into show business.
Okay, fine.
Make jokes, I don't care.
This is a big break for me!
You're right.
It is.
So are you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
But I'm not gonna do that.
Damn it!
Hire the girl.
Okay, everybody ready?
Listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Lose the robe.
Me?
That would work.
Right.
Okay.
Losing the robe!
Okay, and the robe is lost.
Everybody, I would like to get this in one take.
Let's roll it.
Water's working.
And action!
And cut!
Butt guy, what are you doing?
I'm showering.
No, that was clenching.
Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, you know?
His wife's dead, his brother's missing.
I think his butt would be angry here.
I think his butt would like to get the shot before lunch.
Once again, rolling.
Water working.
And action!
And cut!
What was that?
I was going for quiet desperation.
But if you have to ask.
Aren't you the guy who plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
Nope.
No?
What happened, big guy?
Big guy?
It felt like a "big guy" moment.
I got fired!
They said I acted too much with it.
I told everybody about this.
Everybody will be expecting to see me.
You know what?
No one will be able to tell.
My mom will.
There's something so sweet and disturbing about that.
I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years and I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
Maybe this wasn't your shot.
I think when it's your shot, you know it's your shot.
Did it feel like your shot?
Hard to tell.
I was naked.
I don't think this was your shot.
I don't even think you just get one shot.
I really believe big things are gonna happen for you.
I do.
You've gotta keep thinking about the day that some kid will go "I got the part!
I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass! "
You think?
That's so nice.
I'm sorry, Joey.
I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
Good night.
You're gonna leave your shoes out here?
Really?
Just casually strewn about in that reckless, haphazard manner?
It doesn't matter.
I'll get them tomorrow.
Or not!
Whenever.
She is a kook.
If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes.
That's funny, yeah.
You're the funniest man here in abunny costume his wife made him wear.
Relax, man.
You're lookinga little flushed.
Our question might get answered.What question?
Who could kick whose ass in a fight,you or Ross?
There's no question.So you think Ross too?
You picked Ross?Ross is strong.
He's the strongest out of all threeof you.
Except for Joey.
I can't believe you didn't pick me.She's right.
I am stronger.
I would destroy you.
Really?
You think you're stronger?Why don't you prove it?
I'll prove it like a theorem!
All right!
Stop it!
Stop!
No one's gonna fight.
People came to see a fight,let's give them one!
You guys could armwrestle.Listen to the slutty nurse.
You're going down.Oh, yeah?
You're going downtown!
Seriously, guys, the trash talkis embarrassing.
Gunther, you brought candy.Thank you so much.
Okay, guys.
One match,winner take all.
Wait.
What does the winner get?
Pride.And dignity.
Okay, if you say so.
All right, ready, set, go!
Come on!Come on!
Wow, they're both really strong.Or equally weak.
Oh, God.
Chandler's makinghis sex face.
So you getting tired?No.
I could do this all day.
Yeah.
Me too.
Getting a little tired, though.God, I'm exhausted.
This is starting to look bad for me,okay?
Mona's standing right there.
She's talking to Joey!You gotta let me win!
Let me win.My wife thinks I'm a wimp.
At least you have a wife.I get divorces and knock people up.
And I'm dressed as doodie.
You're Spudnik.Come on, who we kidding?
I'm doodie.
Please?
She's watching.
Fine.Thanks.
Oh, no.Oh, yeah!
My hero!
You're a weird lady.
Ursula said she left her purse.
I had to give the kid50 bucks to stop crying.
That's not bad.
I also had to go to a few housesas his girlfriend.
I am awful with children.
You're good with kids.They're just crazy on Halloween.
They're all greedy,hopped up on sugar.
That's all it is?Absolutely.
Halloween is the worst.
Exceptfor Christmas.
And their birthdays.
They get crazy during the summer too.
And any time they'rehungry or sleepy.
Kids are tough.Good luck with that.
Look, I'm sorry you lost.
I got a secret for you.I let him win.
Was that a secret, or a lie?
No, I let him.. Ross?Yeah?
Would you tell herI let you win, please?
Chandler "let me win."
No, Chandler's really strong.My arm is so sore.
Oh, nurse?
I am strong.
I'll show you.
Chandler, please.
What's the matter?
Scared?
Let's go, big bunny!
One, two, three.
Go!
I'm gonna kill myself
Rach, I just remembered.
I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
Really?
I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building... and he was so brave and so strong.
And it's making me look at him totally differently.
He used to be just "Jack Geller, Monica and Ross' dad."
Now he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."
I don't know.
To me, he'll always be "Jack Geller... walks in while you're changing."
Okay, look at him.
Look at those strong hands.
Oh, what I wouldn't give to be that can of condensed milk.
Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
I was taking my Thanksgiving nap and I had another dream.
Do I want to hear this?
I don't know, let's see.
I dreamt we were getting married... and he left because he had to go fight a fire.
So I went to a nightclub and I saw him making out with a girl.
Oh, my God, he dreamcheated on you!
But then Jacques Cousteau came... and he kicked his ass for betraying me.
So cool!
Then he took me diving and introduced me to his sea horse... who was coming on to me.
Please, that is not gonna happen.
Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today.
Five minutes ago, a line like that would have floored me.
But now, nothing.
Well, not nothing.
I am still a woman.
Ross?
Let's go.
Oh, yeah.
About telling Mom and Dad...
I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
That's it.
You've had your chance.
Mom, Dad.
Ross smoked pot in college.
You are such a tattletale!
Mom, Dad... you remember that time you walked in my room... and smelled marijuana?
Yes.
I told you it was Chandler... who was smoking the pot but... it was me.
I'm sorry.
It was you?
And Dad, Chandler didn't melt your records.
And Dad... you know that mailman that you got fired?
He didn't steal your Playboys.
Ross did.
Well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing.
Monica did!
Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year!
That's a lot of information to get in 30 seconds.
All right.
Joey, if you want to leave, just leave.
Rachel, no, you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle.
It did not taste good.
Phoebe, I'm sorry... but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead.
Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact... that you're in an important relationship is beyond me.
And we kind of figured about the porch swing.
Ross.
Drugs?
Divorced again?
What happened, son?
I got tricked into all those things.
Chandler, you've been Ross' best friend all these years... stuck by him during the drug problems... and now you've taken on Monica as well.
Well, I don't know what to say.
You're a wonderful human being.
Thank you!
No.
Thank you!
Monica and Ross, I don't know what I'm gonna do about the two of you.
I'll talk to them.
It's worse when you're twins.
You're a twin?
Yeah.
We don't speak.
She's this highpowered, driven, careertype.
What does she do?
She's a waitress.
All right.
You guys, I kind of gotta clean up now.
Chandler, you're an only child.
You don't have any of this.
No, although I did have an imaginary friend who my parents preferred.
Hit the lights, please.
How long was I in there?
I'm just cleaning up.
Do you need any help?
Okay, sure.
Thanks.
Anyway.
So you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
A little.
A lot.
So, got any advice?
You know, as someone who's recently been dumped.
Well, you may want to steer clear of the word "dumped. "
Chances are he's going to be this broken shell of a man.
You know?
You should try not to look too terrific.
I know it'll be hard.
You know, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring.
And you can go with Carol and Susan to the OBG YN.
You've got Carol tomorrow.
When did it get so complicated?
Got me.
Remember when we were in high school together?
Didn't you think you'd meet someone fall in love, and that'd be it?
Man!
I never thought I'd be here.
Me neither.
Sorry I'm late.
I'm sorry, did you just sayit's Rachel?
Yes.
You like Rachel?
Yes.
I like Rachel.
Rachel?!
Yeah.
Okay, but look, you know..   You know who else I like?
You.
And it doesn't get said enough.I like you, Ross.
"Rachel" Rachel?It's not a big deal.
It's not a big deal?I'm sorry, I just..   What about the stuff you said?
How you can't stop thinking about her?How you can't sleep?
I'm an actor, you know?
As a group, we tend to beoverdramatic.
Rachelwho'scarryingmybaby Rachel?
I know it's bad.And I know it's wrong, okay?
It's not like anything'sever gonna happen.
These are just feelings.They'll go away.
You know, I gotta go.
Hey, Ross..   You know, I just have oneRachel?!
You need to understand something.
I am never gonna acton this Rachel thing, okay?
I wouldn't do anything to jeopardizemy friendship with you.
Thank you.
Anyway, it'll just..
It'll take me a while to get over her.
I'm not sure how to do that.I've never been in love, so..   What?
You're in love with her?
Yeah.
I thought you knew that.No.
Look, if it helps, I don't wantto feel this way, honest.
I just keep thinking,"I'll get over this," you know?
But it just keeps getting harder.
I don't know what to do, you know?
What do I do?
You need to tell her how you feel.That's the green stuff talking.
I'm serious.You need to find out where she is.
If she's not where you are,you can start to move on.
But what if,and I'm not saying she will be..
If she is where you are..   then my feeling weirdshouldn't stand in the way.
Are you sure?Yeah.
If she ends up with somebody else..   the truth is,she couldn't find a better guy.
Hey, thanks.
So when are you gonna talk to her?Oh, my God.
I have to tell her.
I haven't thought about it.What should I say?
I'm understanding,but let's not get carried away.
What am I gonna say?
Yeah, tell me about it.
I'm phasing out the wine importingand focusing more on the cheese.
I think I'm gonna go.Please don't leave like this.
I thought that if I could get you here...
...I could seduce you.
Excuse me?
Seduce you.
I don't wear suits to work.
And I bought six of them from you.
I'm sorry.
I thought you needed them.
My point is, I kept coming back because I wanted to see you.
Why?
Because I like you.
You like me?
I mean, you're beautiful and smart and sophisticated.
A lot of this isn't based on tonight.
But you like me?
I can't believe this.
All this time, I liked you and you liked me!
But No "but."
"But" is never good.
Let's leave it at "I like you and you like me."
Okay.
However No, that's a fancy "but."
My marriage, like, just ended.
And I'm really not ready to get into anything yet.
But...
I'm sorry.
I just need a little time.
Okay.
There you are.
I was looking for you.
Joshua's gone, so you and Emily are free to go.
It's okay.
She's still in there enjoying her fake party.
It's too late to do the stuff I had planned.
I'm sorry.
I ruined your evening.
Yeah.
If it makes you feel any better, I made a fool of myself.
Helps a little.
Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
Have a seat.
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
It was just a twoweek thing anyway.
I just didn't want it to end this way.
Or maybe you didn't want it to end.
What do you mean?
You seem to really like her.
I really do.
But what am I going to do?
We agreed it'd be a twoweek thing.
No commitment.
That girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends... ...asking to hear stories about you... ...looking through Monica's photo albums.
You don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
You think?
You've got 14 hours until she has to be at the airport.
And you're sitting here in a hallway... ...with a 28yearold cheerleader with a fat lip.
You're right.
Thanks.
What photo album was it?
I don't know.
It was you and a bunch of albino kids.
Oh, my God!
Those weren't albino kids.
That was computer camp!
You're a pathetic loser, right?
Oh, yeah.
Sit!
Hi.
Oh, my God.
Joshua.
Look... ...all those things I said about not being ready They're not true?
They're all true.
But...
I love that "but."
Do you want to go inside and get some coffee?
Okay.
If a cow died of natural causes, I could have one of those, right?

You're just all liquored up.
Hey, it's me.
I'm coming in.
I've had a very long, hard day.
Want some chicken?
No, thanks.
No chicken.
Byebye.
You sure?
Some extracrispy, dirty rice?
For the last time, no!
Get out, Joey!
All right.
Are you okay?
He wouldn't leave.
He kept asking me if I wanted chicken.
Chicken?
I could eat some chicken.
Could I get a threepiece, some coleslaw, some beans and a Coke?
Diet Coke.
The One With All the Kissing Morning, Phoebe.
I have to tell you this story.
What took so long?
I got caught up at work.
But I'm quitting tomorrow.
So thanks for having me over.
See you, man.
What the hell was that?
Probably some European goodbye thing he picked up in London.
That's not European.
It felt French.
Come on!
Atlantic City, baby!
Let's roll some bones.
Hey, Joey!
Highfive for rolling bones.
Phoebe, you're leaking.
Oh, my God!
Your water broke!
Oh, okay.
Well, don't worry.
I call shotgun.
Phoebe, we have to take you to the hospital now.
I can't believe Phoebe's going to have her babies!
I know.
It's beautiful and amazing.
I can't believe I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left the room.
It's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
Do you know anything about women?
It's all right.
Okay
This is from the woman at the bar.
Sorry.
She thought you were somebody else.
What time is it?
One.
7:15.
Watch doesn't work.
Tommy's supposed to be here soon.
We're going to lunch.
Look, I wasn't gonna say anything to you, but... All right, I don't think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.
You don't?
The guy is mean.
I mean, really mean.
I think you should stay away from him.
Or maybe I should stay away from all men.
It's not just because I'm jealous.
I mean, I'm not.
I'm not jealous.
Look, the guy actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
Yeah, and at the end of the play... ...he got up, and he just started, like, banging his hands together.
You don't want to believe me, that's fine.
We're kidding.
No one believe me.
I'm Mr.
Funny to you.
Mr.
Funny!
Sorry, Tommy.
What's in the cup?
What is in the cup?
Okay, it's coffee.
Iced coffee?
Tell me it's iced coffee.
It's hot...
Hot coffee!
You idiot!
You gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?
What are you?
Just a big, stupid doofy idiot with a doofy idiot hairdo?
What's your favorite thing about summertime?
Going to the beach when it stays light real late.
What's your favorite thing about summer?
I don't know.
Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
That's a good one.
...I will kill you.
Hey, you mind if I use the phone?
Use ours across the hall because she... ...has problems.
Thanks.
Sorry, Tommy.
I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.
Yeah, but you didn't.
No, but... ...it's hot.
Would you stop it?
It's getting really old.
I can't believe no one believes me.
I do.
I believe you.
You do?
Yeah.
But I also believed her when she said I was next.
Hey there, little fella.
Mr.
Fuzzy Man, how you doing?
Gross!
Idiot!
Stupid, little, fuzzy, yellow creature!
"Oh, look at me!
I'm so cute!
I'm a little chick who's disgusting!"
You're so stupid!
How are you not yet extinct?
What are you quacking about?
Dumb Donald Dodo!
Step away from the duck.
Sorry, little Mr. Chickadee.
Sorry you went doody in my hand!
I guess we're not going out anymore.
Man!
It's been two days.
Yeah, I know.
Good thing it's one of those 801 numbers, right?
Phoebe, 800 is toll free.
801 is Utah.
It has to be 800 because all those big companies have 800 numbers.
Every... Yeah, every big Utahbased company has one.
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I will pay you back.
And yet she's still not hanging up the phone.
Hang up!
Hang up the phone!
Fine!
Fine!
Well, I think I broke it.
But that's all right.
Here's the number where you can call
I've been wanting to tell you something and I just have to get it out.
Okay.
What's up?
Okay, before I tell you I just have to know... ...is your nose okay?
You know how you said to do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
And while that was good advice, you should know that what she wants... ...is for me not to see you anymore.
That's crazy!
You can't do that.
What are you going to tell her?
Oh, my God!
You've already agreed to this.
It's awful, I know.
But I have to do this if I want my marriage to work.
And I do.
I have to make this marriage work.
I have to.
But the good thing is, we can still see each other until she gets here.
Lucky me!
Oh, my God!
That is good news, Ross!
That's the best news I've heard since LaPooh died!
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been.
This is so hard.
Oh, yeah, really?
Is it, Ross?
Let me make this easier for you.
What are you doing?
Storming out.
It's your apartment.
Yeah?
Well, that's how mad I am!
Damn Rolos!
I'm sorry about the whole "lifting out" thing.
You gotta come with me.
Where?
Wherever I go.
You and me, we'll start a new group.
We're the best ones.
Okay, but try to get Joey too.
Phoebe, do you mind if I speak to Rachel alone?
Sure.
Bye, Ross.
Forever.
Why are you here?
Isn't this against the rules?
I talked to Monica.
Look, I'm the one who made the choice.
I'm the one who's making things change.
So I should be the one to, you know, step back.
No, no, it's okay.
Really.
Plenty of people just see their sisters at Thanksgiving... ...their college roommates at reunions... ...and Joey at Burger King.
Is that better?
No, it's not better.
I still don't get to see you.
What would you do?
If you were me, what would you do?
First, I'd have said the right name at my wedding.
I can't believe this.
I know.
I am so sorry.
I know that too.
Hey, Rach?
Sorry to interrupt, but Phoebe said you want to talk to me about a trip?
Wait, if we follow the rules... ...it's still fun and it means something.
I'm going to take off.
The One With Chandler's Dad Whew, that was a brisk ride.
Take the top down, did you?
Only way to fly.
Give me the keys.
Monica's wrong.
I'm an excellent driver.
You're fast and irresponsible.
That adds up to a bad driver.
In high school, that added up to head cheerleader.
Did you see the look that girl just gave me?
She must've seen me cruising in the bad boy.
She's checking out your beehive.
What?
Give me a brush.
The keys.
No way!
Well, no brush.
Fine.
It doesn't matter.
If I remember correctly, there's a comb on the floor of the bathroom.
Alimony.
We still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
Oh, right.
What do you think you're doing?
Just washing the windshield.
There's no way I'll let you drive this car.
Couldn't find the comb?
No.
Why don't you just hand over the keys.
Oh!
Do not start this car.
Okay, okay.
I will give you 20 bucks... ...if you get out of this car right now.
Hey!
Look.
If you're so freaked out, just get in the car.
With you?
Yeah, right.
All right.
Okay, okay, okay.
What, are they crazy?!
God, I forgot how much I love driving.
I have got to get my license renewed.
You don't have a valid driver's license?
Pull over right now.
Ross, you're so tense.
You just gotta relax, okay?
Just need to relax.
All right?
Just need to relax.
What are you...?
That's not funny.
Stop horsing around.
I am not horsing around, okay?
I am "Porscheing" around.
Uhoh.
Stay calm.
Nothing will happen.
You're not in that much trouble.
Really?
You think so?
I was talking to myself.
You're going down!
Andre should be there in about 45 minutes.
Alrighty.
Byebye.
It's just easier that way.
You told me about the last dream.
No.
Forget it.
Why not?
Was I doing something particularly saucy?
AII right.
Fine.
You were not the only one there.
Joey was too.
AII right.
Was there anybody else there?
No.
You sure?
Nobody handing out mints or anything?
No, just the three of us.
So was it you and Chandler then you and me or you, me and Chandler?
You know what?
What?
There were times when it wasn't even me.
Oh, that's nice.
Ross!
I'm here.
You are?
We were just.
What?
Great.
Now I'm having a baby.
What?
I'm having a baby!
I'm hurt.
Monica, let's go!
Come on, people!
Woman in Labor!
Look what I got going.
Save it for the cab.
What are you doing?
We're going to a hospital!
I can't Look nice?
There are doctors there.
Joey, get out of the fridge!
AII right, all right!
What is that?
For the ride.
Like in a cab.
AII right, I'm going.
I'm going.
Here we go.
Saw the new furniture.
Very nice.
Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
I kissed Kathy.
Are you serious?
Does Joey know?
No.
Is there any way you think he will understand this?
You obviously haven't screwed over your friends.
Which we all appreciate.
If you'd told him how you felt before you kissed her... ...knowing Joey, he'd have stepped aside.
Don't say that!
That's not true, is it?
Yeah, he loves you.
Then why didn't you tell me to do that?
I said something to Phoebe.
And I thought it was a really good idea.
Yeah, I remember.
Oh, my God!
What am I going to do?
You'll have to tell him.
Why do I have to tell him?
Because you do.
Yeah, I know.
Would it be okay if I wrote a song about this?
Sambuca margarita?
It that a real thing?
Well, we only had sambuca, so it is now.
Listen, Joe.
I need to I need to talk to you about something.
What's up?
It's about Kathy.
I like her.
I like her a lot, actually.
You do?
Yeah.
Your timing couldn't be better.
She's not my girlfriend anymore.
What?
Yeah, she broke up with me.
When?
Just now, after acting class.
I thought she was doing some scene, so I let people watch.
Man, I am so sorry.
Are you okay?
I've been better, but I'm all right.
So you like her?
Yes, but I don't have to.
No, it's okay.
You know why?
Because you came to me first.
I thought that would be the best thing to do.
You might have your work cut out for you.
When I talked to her, I got the feeling she's into some other guy.
See, that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about.
I think I know who the other guy is.
Who?
It's me.
I'm the other guy.
What?
When you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking... ...and one thing led to another, and... And what?
Did you sleep with her?
No, I just kissed her.
What?
That's even worse!
How is that worse?
It's the same!
There's nothing I could do.
I think I'm in love with her!
Who cares?
You went behind my back?
I'd never do that to you!
I have no excuses.
I was totally over the line.
You're so far past the line, that you can't even see the line!
The line is a dot to you!
Yes, right!
And I feel horrible.
You have to believe me.
Oh, my God.
Is that why you bought all this stuff?
You know what?
I will not watch your TV.
I won't listen to your stereo.
And there's a loaf in the new bread maker I won't eat.
Know why?
Probably because It's all tainted with your betrayal!
This apartment is empty to me!
I'm not happy about you either.
And just so you know...
...I made that bread for you.

What are you doing here?
Watching you sleep.
Why?
It makes me feel peaceful.
Please.
I can't sleep now!
You want me to sing?
That's it.
I want you out of the apartment now!
What are you talking about?
Hannibal Lecter?
Better roommate than you.
I don't think you're being fair!
One night you see me and you get scared.
What about the other nights when you don't see me?
Last night you went and got some water... ...and I was nice enough to hide behind the door.
I didn't realize that.
Get out now!
You really want me out?
Yes, please.
Then I want to hear you say you want me out.
I want you out.
I want to hear it from your lips.
Where'd you hear it before?
All right.
You know what?
Consider me gone.
I will go to my brother's basement.
I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow.
Thank you.
I heard that.
The One Where Eddie Won't Go Well, look at you!
What are you still doing here?
Just some basic dehydrating of fruits and vegetables.
Man alive, this thing's fantastic!
Aren't you forgetting anything?
Oh, yeah.
I got us a new goldfish.
He's feistier than the last one.
Maybe because the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm.
Eddie, isn't there something you're supposed to be doing now?
Not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating.
Because right now, I'm a dehydrating maniac!
I thought we had a deal.
I thought by the time I got You know what that is?
Your last roommate's kidney?
That's a tomato.
This one definitely goes in the display.
Hey, Gunther.
Why must everybody watch me sleep?
There'll be no more watching me sleep!
No more... ...watching!
I got some great stuff to dehydrate.
Grapes, apricots.
I thought it'd be cool to see what happens with these water balloons.
Get out.
Get out, get out, get out!
What?
You!
Move out!
Take your fruit!
Your stupid small fruit and get out!
You want me to move out?
I gotta tell you, that's kind of out of the blue, don't you think?
This is not out of the blue!
This is smackdab in the middle of the blue!
Relax!
Take it easy, buddy!
You don't have to tell me twice.
Someone will be by for my stuff.
If you think I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane!
You want some help?
No help required, chico!
If you hated it so much, why'd you buy it in the first place?
I did not have sex.
This pregnancy is throwing me all off and making me fat.
I'll say hi to the chick and duck.
Me too!
Why would you need to?
You've been feeding them.
Oh, right.
Maybe I'll just go home.
We certainly are alone.
Good thing we have that "not New York" rule.
Listen, since we're on that subject...
...I just wanted to tell you that...
I was going through a hard time in London... ...with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross' mother.
Well, anyway, I just... That night meant a lot to me.
And I'm trying to say thanks.
You know, that night meant a lot to me too.
It wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything.
It just meant a lot because you're really hot.
Is that okay?
That's okay.
And I'm cute too?
And you're cute too!
Thank you.
All right, I gotta go unpack.
I'm still on London time.
Does that count?
Oh, that counts!
Oh, good!
Oh, good, I'm dating a Russian cabdriver.
Seriously, does anyone buy this?
I smell like beets.
I really like those jackets with the shoulder pads in them.
Where are those?
On Melanie Griffith in Working Girl.
I think what you want is over here.
See, I told you I needed someone.
By the way, as a thank you, I would really love to take you out.
Really?
Joey and I are going to a movie tonight.
You want to come?
Oh, I can't.
Because I've seen them.
You've seen all the movies?
Yeah.
I'm a big fan.
Of the movies.
You know, motion pictures.
The talkies.
Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?
Sure.
Okay.
Maybe we could do something else.
You know, that depends on what it is.
I've done a lot of stuff.
So, what were you doing out there?
Do you not like Charlie?
She's okay.
I don't know, I just don't get a really good vibe from her.
Why?
I don't know.
You know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart..   and tall, you know..   and just swept Joey off his feet.
Nobody else has a chance.
Who else?
Anybody.
You.
Me.
You know, Monica's mom.
You like Joey?!
Phoebe!
All right, look, I do.
I have a little thing for him.
Just..    Oh, my God.
It's just physical.
I have it totally under control, okay?
It's just when I see them together..   sometimes, I just get a little jealous.
Wow.
Isn't that ironic that he liked you, and now you like..?
I get it!
All right, as long as it's under control.
You can't do anything about it.
He's already dating her.
She is a nice person.
That wouldn't be right.
I know, I know.
So it's just not a big deal.
So can we keep this between us?
Sure.
Great, because I gotta get out of here.
The smell of beets is killing me.
Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
Hi, honey.
Oh, God, do you think she heard?
It'd be so bad if she heard.
Maybe she didn't hear.
I'll go into that dressing room and talk.
You stay here.
See if you can hear me.
Okay, great.
Oh, thank God, I can't hear a word that you're saying.
I didn't say anything yet.
Well, get back in there and talk.
I'm Rachel.
It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
What?
Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.
Okay, well, I heard that.
Which means that she heard it too.
We have a problem.
Oh, what are we gonna do?
Just be honest with her.
Oh, my God!
It is annoying when parents put babies on the phone.
Let's just go over there and see if she heard.
Good plan.
Okay.
What?
Where are you going?
Oh, I'm sorry, Rachel.
I don't have time for your childish games, okay?
I still have to find something incredible to wear..   so I can beat Mike at "Who's More Over Who"!
Where have you been?
Trying on clothes.
Oh, really?
In the dressing room?
Well, that's so weird.
Phoebe and I were in the dressing room.
Gosh, it's just such a small world.
Rachel, I heard you two guys whispering.
Oh, God, you did, you heard.
Okay, look, let me explain.
There's nothing to explain.
I heard you.
Phoebe likes Joey.
Yeah.
I don't understand it.
I mean, Phoebe likes Joey..   and then she's here to buy a dress to impress another guy?
Yeah, that's Phoebe.
That's Phoebe.
You know, she just wants them all.
It's, like, she's nympho.
Wow!
Yeah.
You know, by the way, I heard you tell her not to do anything.
Thanks for sticking up for me.
God, you are such a nice person.
I try.
Oh, my God, you really want me to be the keynote speaker?
I went by the photo shop.Take a look.
Here is a mockup of our card.What do you think?
Wow, that's great.
Do you think it should say,"Love, Ross and Mona"?
Well, we haven't said thatto each other yet..   but I guess it's okayto say it to other people.
How many did you want?
I'll get 100.A hundred?
Well, I guess I'll take..   Mona?
I'm not sureabout the whole card thing.
Really?
Why not?
Sending out a holiday card together?
I just don't knowif we're really quite there yet.
I didn't think of it that way.You're right.
So can I ask you a question?Yeah.
Where are we?
You know, where are we?Where is this relationship going?
I love spending time with you.I just hope we're moving forward.
We should talk about that,don't you think?
Let's do the card!
What?The card!
I think we're there!
Okay.
But I still thinkwe should have this conversation.
Mona, it's time we had a conversationabout where things are with us.
Yeah, I think I suggested that.
We are so..   Well, I really like you.And I love hanging out with you.
And I'm having a lot of fun.
Okay.
There's no point in spending timewith someone if it's just fun.
It's gotta be going somewhere, right?
So where is it going?
That's the real question.
And the answer is..   it's going somewhere..   fun.
I know what you're thinking.Fun was fine for you 10 years ago.
But you're not getting any younger.
No!
I mean, not you.Not you.
You are getting younger!
You're getting younger by the second.What's your secret?
I'm sorry, so where are we?
Well, to sum up..   we're having fun.You look young.
Okay..But that's not enough.
So..   here's a key to my apartment.
Really?Really.
You don't think this is too fast?
You gave her a keyto your apartment?
I'm gonna need a bunchof extra keys.
Apparently, I give them awayfor no reason at all.
Ross, what's going on?You're changing the lock?
No.
That guy is.
You give me a key to your apartment,and then you change the lock?
Good luck, buddy.
I thought we were moving forward.
Nowyou're sending me all these mixed signals.
What are you trying to tell me?
I'm trying to tell you..
I made you a mix tape.
What?I love you.
And I love spending time with you.
"Happy birthday, Grandma.
It's better to be over the hill... ...than buried under it.
All our love, Monica and Chandler."
That's funny.
No, no.
That was a joke.
I know, I get it.
It's funny.
Because you're not a grandma.
To be a grandma, you have to be married and have children.
I don't have any of those things.
I'm just gonna go... All you had to do was buy the card.
Hey, look who's back.
Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.
It was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.
All I really needed was a plan.
See, I want three kids.
And you want to have them all at the same time and have them for your brother.
As I was saying...
I should have the first one by the time I'm 35.
If you could do that, I'd marry the Hippity Hop.
If I want a kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34.
Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes.
But I want to be married for a year before I get pregnant.
Really?
That long?
Look all you want, it's happening.
I don't have to get married until I'm 33.
That's three whole years.
Wait a minute, though.
I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding.
And I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half... ...before we get engaged.
Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm 30.
Which is fine because you just turned... ...28!
No, Ross.
No, it is not fine.
I should already be with the guy I'm gonna marry.
Will you quit hogging it?
Hey, Joey...  Come on, Rach, my turn just started.
Actually, I just want to talk to Tag.
Oh, okay.
Hey, can I ride this outside?
Whatever.
I'm not your mother.
Not in the street!
Are you feeling any better?
Yeah, I'm doing okay.
I'm... Let's talk.
What's up?
Oh, Tag... You're such a great guy.
And we have so much fun together.
But I...
Wait.
I think I see where you're going.
But before you say anything else, can I say one more thing?
Well said.
And a good example of the fun I was referring to.
But I think I'm past the point where I can just have fun.
Rachel, don't do this.
This is just because you're turning 30.
Yeah, it is.
But you're just a kid.
I mean, you're 25.
Twentyfour, actually.
Oh, God.
You know what I wish?
I wish you were six years older.
Well, if I'm wishing for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.
Me too.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Hey, how'd it go?
If I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
You did the right thing.
I don't like this anymore.
Well, here we are.
Just a bunch of 30yearolds.
Do you realize in 10 years we're gonna be 40?
Why, God?
Why are you doing this to us?
You want to buy a car
I'm still right.
That is so not true.
What?
I know it's her laundry day... ...and that means she's wearing her oldlady underpants.
I can check that for you.
You two think you know me and Rachel... ...better than we know you.
Well, we do.
You can only eat Tic Tacs in even numbers.
What's that about?
And you!
Ross, if you check Rachel's bag... ...you'll find a halfeaten box of cookies in there.
You're good.
These are not.
I'm so not impressed.
Everybody snacks when they shop.
Ross, how many items left in that bag?
Five.
Okay, 10 bucks says we can name every item in that bag.
How many guesses?
Six.
Challenge extended.
Deal!
Challenge accepted.
All right, we'll start with... ...apples.
We'll be starting with apples.
Stop that now.
Yes.
Okay.
Tortilla chips.
Yogurt.
Diet soda.
Orange juice.
There's no orange juice!
We win!
They have another guess.
Well, we won that one.
Okay.
The last thing is Not for another two weeks.
I got it.
Scotch... ...tape.
How did you know she would buy Scotch tape?
We used up theirs last night making scary faces.
Oh, man!
Do you realize that any minute now... ...Phoebe could be pregnant?
I know, I know.
It's such a huge, lifealtering thing.
The test is ready.
Okay.
Each team will answer 10 questions.
The first team to answer the most questions wins.
The categories are "Fears and Pet Peeves"... ..."Ancient History"... ..."Literature"... ...and "It's all Relative."
Now... ...the coin toss, to see who goes first.
Okay.
Somebody call it this time.
Tails!
It's heads.
Gentlemen, pick your category.
"Fears and Pet Peeves."
"What is Monica's biggest pet peeve?"
Animals dressed as humans.
Correct.
Ladies?
Same category.
"According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejesus out of him?"
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!
That is correct.
The Irish jig guy?
His legs flail about as if independent from his body!
Gentlemen, your pick.
"It's all Relative."
"Monica and I had a grandmother who died.
You both went to her funeral.
Name that grandmother."
Nana?
She has a real name.
Althea!
What?
I took a shot!
With Althea?
Althea is correct.
Nice shooting!
"Literature."
"Every week the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey's apartment.
What name appears on the address label?"
Chandler gets it!
It's Chandler Bing!
I'm afraid the TV Guide comes to "Chanandler Bong."
I knew that!
Rachel, use your head!
Actually, it's Ms. Chanandler Bong.
He's got a severed toe on his right foot.
Could you please not do that feet first?
You know where his injury is.
Severed toe, you just said it!
It says the knife went through your shoe.
They're made of wicker!
Did you bring the toe?
I have it right here on ice.
Don't worry, son.
We'll just reattach it and then... What is it?
You brought a carrot.
This isn't your toe.
This is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
You brought a carrot?
Oh, my God!
There's a toe in my kitchen.
I'm sorry!
I'll go get it!
All we can do now is sew up the wound.
Without my toe?
I need my toe!
I can go really fast!
Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche.
I'm not falling for that one.
That's why I lost my toe?
Because I called you fat?
I didn't mean to cut it off.
It was an accident.
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limpsalot?
I'm sorry.
It wasn't your whole toe.
Yeah, well, I miss the tip.
It's the best part.
It has the nail.
Sir Limpsalot.
I came up with that.
You're a dork.
I can't believe this.
I said I was sorry.
"Sorry" doesn't bring back the piggy that cried all the way home.
It figures that something like this would happen today.
I hate this stupid day and everything about it!
I'll see you later.
Wait.
Come here.
Is there anything I can do?
Anything?
Just leave me alone for a little while.
I'm a duck.
I go quackquack.
I'm happy all the time.
Nice try.
Wait, wait, wait.
Look, Monica This is not going to work.
I bet this will work.
You're so great.
I love you.
Nothing.
I said you're so great, and then I just stopped talking.
You said you loved me.
I can't believe this!
You love me!
No, I don't!
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Richard told me he loved me.
Oh, my God!
I know!
Honey, that's great!
I know!
I just can't find  Top drawer.
Hurry.
Why?
You need one too?
Found them!
There's only one.
We'll be right there.
We're just trying to decide something.
They're trying to decide something.
Good.
Good, good.
So was your mustache Did it used to be different?
How do you, you know, keep it so neat?
I have a comb.
What is that?
A mustache comb.
Thank you.
Okay, I will do your laundry for one month.
I will, I will, I will...
I will clean the apartment for two months.
I'll give this to you now, if you tell me where we keep the dustpan.
So were you in Nam?
We are both adults here.
We must got some way to solve this.
One, two, three.
Yes!
Fine.
Go have sex.
No!
You have got it completely wrong!
John Savage was Deer Hunter, no legs.
Jon Voight was Coming Home, couldn't feel his legs.
You've got it totally the other way around, my friend.
Jon Voight Honey?
What?
Shall we?
It's not gonna happen.
They're doing it tonight.
We can do it tomorrow.
In the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand...
So when I woke up this morning... ...he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes!
Oh, man.
Let's never speak of this.
You got it
Oh, this is so intense!
One side of my butt is totally asleep and the other side has no idea.
Hi!
Did you order some bananas?
What about it?
Give me my monkey back!
I don't have a monkey.
Then what's with all the bananas?
Potassium.
Okay, where is he?
Where is he?
What have you done to him?
That's my monkey.
That's Patty the monkey.
Are you insane?
Come here, Marcel.
Come here, Patty.
Come here, Marcel.
Come here, Patty.
Here, monkey.
Here, monkey.
Gotcha!
Give me my monkey back!
That's my monkey.
Take this up with the judge.
That's not my monkey.
Just the dress is mine.
You can send it back whenever.
All right, I want my monkey!
Oh, come on, Luisa.
Sorry, prom queen.
You had to be a bitch in school, you couldn't have been fat.
In high school, I was the prom queen and the homecoming queen and the class president and you were also there.
If you take this monkey, I'll lose one of the most important people in my life.
You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him.
Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here.
Take it!
Then I'll call your supervisor and tell her you shot my friend in the ass with a dart!
It'll be nice to get this off, won't it?
Or we can leave it on for now.
That's fine.
With the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
Listen.
I'm sorry I was so hard on you before.
No, come on.
It was my fault.
I almost lost your.
But you got him back.
You were great.
We still have that bottle of wine.
Are you in the mood for something grape?
Sure, that would be good.
All right.
The neighbors must be vacuuming.
Well, as long as we're here and not on the subject.
I was thinking about how mad we got at each other before.
And I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we.
Rachel?
Barry?
I can't.
I can't do it.
I can't marry Mindy.
I'm still in love with you.
We have got to start locking that door!
This is me in The Sound of Music.
You see the von Trapp kids?
Because I'm in front of them.
I thought that was an alp.
High school was not my favorite time.
I don't know.
I loved high school.
It was just like four years of parties and dating and sex and.
Well, I went to boarding school with 400 boys.
Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
Doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
My butt cheek is waking up
The One With Unagi What are you up to?
We went to a selfdefense class today.
Kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of you.
Takes it out of you?
Now we can kick anybody's ass.
After one class?
I don't think so.
You want to see me selfdefend myself?
Pretend you're a predator.
Go on, I dare you!
Of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming.
That's not enough.
Look, I studied karate for a long time.
And there's a concept you should be familiar with.
It's what the Japanese call unagi.
Isn't that a kind of sushi?
No, it's a concept.
Yeah, it is.
It's freshwater eel.
Maybe it means that too.
I would kill for a salmonskin roll right now.
Fine, get attacked.
I don't even care.
Come on, Ross, we're sorry.
Please tell us what it is.
Unagi is a state of total awareness.
Only by achieving true unagi... can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you.
In case someone's trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat... or your kettle of fish?
It's one thing being prepared for an attack against each other.
Whole other story being prepared for an attack.
I don't know..
Surprise!
You knew that was coming... but that doesn't mean you have unagi.
If we made reservations, we could have unagi in a halfhour.
A lesson in the importance of unagi.
You're a freak!
Perhaps.
Now I'm curious.
At what point during those girlish screams would you have kicked my ass?
All right, so we weren't prepared!
I'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point.
I just want you to be safe.
Danger!
Why not?
It says "Captain Ross" on the side.
And it says "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
Danger!
Salmonskin roll.
Yes, honey, I made it myself.
Pat Sajak?
Yep.
Alex Trebek?
Of course.
Chuck Woolery?
Definitely.
You will not find a single gameshow host whose ass I cannot kick.
Say it!
Say we are unagi!
It's not something you are, it's something you have.
Say it!
I could easily get out of this... but there's a chance you could get very, very hurt!
Nowhere to run.
I don't like sitting up here.
I'm gonna go over.. No, they got here first.
Why is Ross doing that?
Danger!
Oh, my God!
Why is he jumping on those women?
We should help them.
I don't think they need any help
You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
That's what it seemed like.
I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.
Fine, then why didn't you say something?
Because it is too damn hard Ross.
I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you.
When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go...
Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you  because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else,  you're wrong.
It's because you mean more to me.
So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!
Rach!
What?
You keep, you keep... You can't...  WHAT?
Okay, all right, let's do this.
All right, ready?
Yeah.

We could call it Chuck.
Or Dick.
Hey.
Hey.
Listen, I need a favor.
I was in the shower, and as I was... ...cleansing myself, I felt something.
Was it like a sneeze, only better?
No.
I mean, like, a thing on my body.
Well, what was it?
Well, I don't know.
It's kind of in a place that's not...
It's not visually accessible to me.
And I was hoping maybe you guys... ...could help me out.
Come on, you guys!
It's no big deal!
Well, what is it?
Is it a mole?
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.
Is it...?
What, a pimple?
No, it's... ...fancier than a pimple.
Ross, just go see a doc...  Guys, what's...?
Well, it's definite.
Two more weeks of winter.
Yeah, right.
You know?
Just your runofthemill third nipple.
You can take it off.
Just slice that baby right off.
Take your shirt off.
Let's see what we're dealing with.
What are you doing?
Just showing you my runofthemill, sliceitrightoff third nipple.
Well, that's not a third nipple.
First of all, it's on your ass.
Well, then, what is it?
Wait a minute.
Hold it.
Jansen, come in here.
I'm with Hamilton.
He's good with weird things.
Bring him in too.
You know, I have dinner plans.
Thank you so much for coming on such a short notice.
Ladies and gentlemen, I've been practicing medicine for 23 years... ...and I'm stumped.
You must be Ross.
Hi.
I am Guru Saj.
Listen, I gotta tell you, I've never been to a guru before, so... Well, relax.
If it makes you feel any better, I've attended... ...fine medical schools in Central America.
Well, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours.
Come on, have a seat.
As I suspected, it's a kundus.
What's a "kundus"?
I don't know.
What's a kundus with you?
Please lie down.
I've got a salve that ought to shrink that right up.
I guess it's worth a try.
Sure.
We should see results... Clearly not the way to go!
What?
What?
We appear to have angered it.
We?
We angered it?
I think I see the problem.
And I'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool.
Love.
Oh, God!
I love the kundus.
There is absolutely no way this is gonna come off... ...unless you start to... What was that?
He's got a really bad cough, and our vet can't do anything about it.
Drake, what are you doing here?
Stopping you from marrying the wrong man..   and making the biggest mistake of your life.
Get out.
You don't love him.
What do you know about love?
I know what I felt that night when we kissed under the bridge.
That kiss never happened.
Well, what about this one?
Now, I told you to get out.
Fine, I'll go.
But let me ask you one question.
You look real familiar.
Have we..?
Shh!
He's asking her a question.
Can you live the rest of your life never knowing what we could have been?
I don't have a choice.
Yes, you do.
Yes, you do.
I'm the one who doesn't have a choice because I..   Because I can't stop loving you.
Don't say that.
Tell me to stop.
Just..   tell me to stop.
Cut!
No!
Or, cut.
You know, that's your call.
Everything was delicious.
Joey, I gotta tell you, I have been thinking all day about that scene you did.
I mean, you were amazing.
You know, the writing was good.
And the director's good.
And my costar's good.
But they're not as good as me!
You have to tell me what happens tomorrow.
I'm going over the script now.
Wanna read lines with me?
Me?
Oh, I'm not an actress.
All right, I can ask Monica.
Screw her!
That part is mine!
Okay, so just from the top of the page right here.
Okay.
Hello, Drake.
I'm surprised to see you here.
I can't believe you married him.
Well, what choice did I have?
He was keeping my sister in a dungeon.
So, what about us?
Everything we feel for each other?
It's over.
You have to accept that.
How can I, knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again..   or touch your skin or feel your lips..   knowing I'll never make love to you?
How can I accept that I can never kiss you again..   when it's all I can do not to kiss you right now?
Kiss me.
What?
Kiss me.
Rach, it doesn't say that.
No, I'm saying it.
But..  Just don't talk.
Well, that's new.
Yeah, I think I can do that.
Yeah.
Okay, there's this party scene coming up.
And Olivia and her husband are there..   and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't.
That makes me think about those times I wanted to grab you and kiss you..   but you didn't know, so I would just pretend everything was cool..   but really it was killing me.
Joey, you never talked about that before.
Hey, you know what else I could use?
There's this scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom..   and she doesn't know he's there, which never happened with us.
I mean, he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her.
You know?
And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your makeup..   when I would think to myself, "My God, she is beautiful."
And it hurt so much because I knew I could never tell you.
But it was worth it just to be there looking at you.
Thanks, dude.
Oh, my God.
Maple candy.
That's so sweet of you.
That's weird, it's empty.
Listen, to be honest, home deliveriesaren't really part of my job description.
Oh, I actually came hereto ask you out.
Oh.
Wow.Yeah, that sounds great.
I'm just gonna put this back in mypocket and pretend that didn't happen.
I'm free now.You want to get coffee..?
Sure.Horny bitch.
No, you're a horny bitch!No, you're a horny bitch!
No, you're a horny bitch!
You guys have a good time.
I'm just gonna grab my coat.And my whip.
You know, because of lndiana Jones.
Not because I'm into S & M.   I'm not into anything weird, you know?
Just normal sex.
So I'm gonna grab my coat.
So you had a good day, huh?Big commission, picked up a daddy.
Are you okay with this?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, please.You guys have fun.
Okay.Yeah.
I'll look forward to your call.
Hey.Hey.
You're back.How are you?
I'm fine.
But that's not important.What's important is how was she?
It was fun.We just had coffee.
Oh, uhhuh, uhhuh, coffee,a little rubrubrub under the table?
What's going on?Do you not like Katie?
No.
No, she was nice.
I mean,she was a little slutty, but who isn't?
Well, I liked her.
Of course you did.
You'd date a gorillaif it called you lndiana Jones.
Did you get a fresh batchof pregnancy hormones today?
No.
It's just that..Katie bothered me.
Why?
What was wrong with her?
There was nothing wrong with her.She was lovely.
Okay.
So, what's the matter?I don't want you to date her.
Why?
What, are you jealous?
Yes.
And not becauseI want you to go out with me.
Because I don't want youto go out with anybody.
It's terrible to even think thisand it's inappropriate..   but I want you to be at my constantbeck and call, 24 hours a day.
I'm very sorry, but that isjust the way that I feel.
Okay.What?
I won't date.
I'll..
I'll be here with you all the time.
Really?
But I'm being so unreasonable.
True, but you're allowed to beunreasonable.
You're having our baby.
Oh, Ross, thank you.
Thank you.
You feel better?
No, not really.
You're pressingthe baby into my bladder..   and now I have to pee.
Okay.Rach?
Yeah?Just one thing..   We live together.
You're having ourbaby.
I'm not gonna see anybody else.
Are you sure you don't wantsomething more?
Wow.
I don't know, maybe..   Oh, Rach, I was just messing around.
Like you did when I had to pee?Oh!
I knew that.
Can anybody tell me what the differencebetween upstage and downstage is?
Hey, what do you say?
We, uh,  move this onto the likes of the couch?
I say cheesy line but it's okay.
What's the matter?
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
I don't remember why I did that.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Again,  I don't know, I don't know what happened.
I must be nervous.
I don't get it.
Chandler loved it.
Oh, okay.
I promise, I promise I won't do it again.
I really do.
I promise.
This is gonna be great!
OKay.
/ Okay.
Uh, was that good for you?
Okay, let's work from the top down.
Just work the bra, Joe!
Okay.
Got it, yeah.
Okay / Okay  This things is welded shut.
/ Okay.
Alright, turn around.
I got to get a look at this thing.
Uh , okay.
Ow!
/ Sorry.
Well, this is romantic.
I'm sorry.
This has never happened to me before.
I'm an expert at taking off bras.
I can do it with one hand.
I could do it with my eyes closed.
One time I just looked at one, and it popped open!
I blame your bra.
It's a standard issue bra clasp!
Well, then I blame you!
Yeah!
That's right.
You threw me off with all your slapping!
Ok, look.
Well, I'm really, I'm sorry about that, Joey but  do you think it may be on, on some level,  you , you don't want to take off my bra?
Nah, I don't have another level!
I do not know what's wrong with us.
I mean, we, we've kissed before and that's been great!
But this time it was leading somewhere  and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
Well, you guys've been friends forever.
Remember the first time that you kissed Ross ?
How weird that was?
You couldn't stop laughing.
You got through that.
Um hmm.
Okay.
That's true.
That's true.
We can do this.
You're right.
You're right.
We can do this.
We're just gonna power through!
Hey, uh, Chandler.
Can I talk to you for a second?
No need!
Problem solved!
We are powering through!
Chandler, stop!
It's not going to pop open!
You don't know!
Hi, Phoebe.
/ Hey  Is Amanda here yet?
Ready to power through!
Excellent, okay.
Stick it in the ice bucket.
The phone is off the hook.
And in the interest of powering through.
/ Woo!
Okay, sexy, sexy.
Very sexy.
sexy.
Alright, let's do it!
Okay, you're scaring me a little bit.
Oh, get over it, solider.
We got to do this!
/ Okay.
Okay, ha ha.
You like that, huh?
Oh, yeah.
/ You like that?
Let's kick this into high gear, huh?
Yeah, baby, I'll show you how we do it.
No, no, no,  You kneed me in my masters!
/ What?
Oh my God!
I'm so sorry.
Joey, are you okay?
I have nothing...to say to you.
Wow, my flat is twice this size.
Oh, great.
After I finish my wine..
I'm gonna blow my averagesized brains out.
What's the matter?
She only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners.
Oh, my God, at the Chinese restaurant earlier today..
I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretended to be a woolly mammoth.
I always loved that.
Of course you would!
Your brains are smaller than mine!
I can't compete with the guys she goes out with.
They're so out of my league.
Oh, my God!
Worse?
Oh, much, much worse.
I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians.
"Can we walk?"
Oh, you like that?
No.
What?
Pass.
Why?
What's wrong with these guys?
Well, nothing major.
It's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you..   and you deserve the best.
Joey, you're so sweet.
It's true, but it doesn't matter.
I already know who you're going home with.
Who?
Me.
What?
Really?
Yeah, because we live together.
It's a joke!
So how did you enjoy the play?
Oh, my God.
Honey, I am so, so, so, so sorry.
Well, you should be.
You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
You really liked it?
Oh, yeah.
I mean, at first I hated it.
But why wouldn't l?
Because as a man, I've been trained not to listen!
But after Chapter 16:   Fat, Single and Ready to Mingle..
I was uplifted.
Oh, really?
Oh, yeah.
I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman.
Tell me.. Tell me about your first period.
No!
Did somebody sign your bra?
So I got it when I was 13.
Very difficult.
Hey, Ross?
So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl?
Are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel Prizes scare you off?
What is that?
Come on, a piece of paper?
It's actually a milliondollar prize.
Go, Charlie!
But my point is..   okay, so she dated them, but she also broke up with them.
Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Ph.D.   Yeah, maybe, and I do have my whole career in front of me.
I mean..
I could still win a Nobel Prize.
Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.
You're so much more than just brains.
You are sweet and kind and funny.
And sexy.
Okay, well, give her a chance to see all that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're right.
Thanks.
I'm gonna go find her.
Good for you.
And your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian Era was topnotch.
Stop going through my stuff!
I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind.
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna kiss Joey.
No!
You can't!
Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
Please!
What about you and Chandler?
That's different.
I was drunk and stupid.
Well, hello?
What about all the guys that you got the phone numbers from?
Why don't you just kiss one of them.
I could..   but I don't want to.
I want to kiss Joey.
All right.
I think it's a big mistake, but it's your decision.
I'm gonna do it.
And I can't stop you?
No.
Well, can I at least have the phone numbers.
Hey, Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?
Why Don't You Like Me?
Chapter 1: My First Period.
I was kind of using that machine.
Yeah, well, now you're kind of not.
But I saved it.
I put my basket on top.
I'm sorry.
Is that your basket?
It's really pretty.
Unfortunately, I don't see suds!
What?
No suds, no save, okay?
What's going on?
Nothing.
This horrible woman just took my machine.
Was your basket on top?
Yeah, but there were no suds.
So?
You know, no suds, no save.
No suds, no.
Excuse me.
Hold on a second!
This is my friend's machine.
Hey, hey, hey!
Her stuff wasn't in it!
Hey, hey, hey!
That's not the rule, and you know it!
All right.
Show's over.
Nothing to see here.
Let's do laundry.
That was amazing!
I can't even send back soup.
Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle.
You must need detergent.
What's that?
Uberweiss.
It's new.
It's German.
It's extra tough!
Are you gonna separate those?
Oh, God.
Am I being like a total laundry spaz?
Am I supposed to use one machine for shirts and another for pants?
Have you never done this before?
Well, not myself.
But I know other people that have.
Okay.
You caught me.
I'm a laundry virgin.
Don't worry.
I'll use the gentle cycle.
Basically, you wanna use one machine for all your whites.
A whole other machine for your colors.
And a third for your delicates.
And that would be your bras and your underpanty things.
These are white cotton panties.
Would they go with whites or with delicates?
That would be a judgment call.
He's so cute!
You got the clothes clean.
That's the important part.
I guess.
Except everything looks like jammies now.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
We had this cart.
I had a 24inch waist.
You lose things.
Now, come on.
Get out of my way.
I'm sorry.
Maybe I wasn't being clear.
This was our cart.
There aren't any clothes in it!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Quit making up rules!
Let go!
Come on, it's my cart.
Listen, Mitzi, if you want this cart you're gonna have to take me with it!
Yes!
Did you see that?
You were incredible.
A brandnew woman, ladies and gentlemen.
More clothes in the dryer?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Are you sure?
Are you sure you're okay?
Does it still hurt?
What a neat idea.
All your clothes match.
I'm gonna do this.
How'd it go?
Excellent!
We ripped that couple apart and kept the pieces for ourselves.
What a beautiful story.
I'm fine, by the way.
I'm sorry.
Where's Chandler?
He needed some time to grieve.
I'm free!
I'm free!
That ought to do it
I can't believe her.
It's just so typical.
I know you're upset, but don't forget there is going to be a wedding.
You are going to throw the bouquet, and then a honeymoon.
Maybe in Paris.
Paris?
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la blahblahblah.
Keep talking.
We will sprinkle rose petals on the bed and make love... ...not just because it's romantic, but because I can.
I love you.
Don't say anything, you might scare it away.
It's Paris.
Who knows we're here?
Hi, Pheebs.
What's up?
You said I could sing at your wedding, so I need a small deposit.
You know, some goodfaith money to hold the date.
We're not giving you a deposit for our wedding.
Oh, I see.
They break your heart, don't they?
You know, I don't really need their permission.
You want to sing at their wedding, sing at their wedding.
Yeah, and if you want to look 19, then you... You got to do something about your eyes.
What's wrong with my eyes?
They give you away.
There's too much wisdom in there.
Put some tea bags on them for 15 minutes.
That'll get rid of my wisdom?
Maybe 10 minutes for you.
Rachel, I've been thinking.
I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea.
I'm calling it off.
Way to save your dignity, my man.
Mon, why, why would I ever want to take away from your night?
I don't know, maybe you feel a little resentful.
Maybe you thought you'd get married first.
Maybe you can't stand... ...that your formerly fat friend is getting married before you.
Oh, wow, that... You know what?
That is so unfair.
Now I want to steal your thunder.
Come on, Ross.
Let's go have sex!
I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night.
Well, somebody should.
Look, if we're gonna do this... We're not.
She's just gonna think we are.
I see, so everybody wins.
Who is it?
It's Monica, open up.
Okay, Ross, stop it.
Please, wait a minute.
Yeah, you like that, baby?
May we help you?
I wanted to say I hope you have sex, and I hope you get back together.
I warn you, the night you announce your engagement...
...I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant.
How is that ever going to happen?
Do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?
I know why.
You don't.
Okay, why?
Because I was sad.
What do you mean?
Look, I am so... ...so happy for you guys.
But you getting married reminds me of the fact that I'm not.
I'm not even close.
Maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better.
I know that that's dumb, but you were so depressed... ...when Ross got married, you slept with Chandler.
I don't care, she slept with me.
Anyway, sweetie, I am so sorry I ruined your night.
I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
I'm gonna take off.
Congratulations, man.
Thanks.
And Rachel... ...what can I say?
You missed your chance.
From now on, the only person who's going to enjoy these bad boys is me.
We thought Phoebe would leave But she just stayed and stayed That's right, I'm here all night And Chandler will never get... Hey, here's a dollar.
I want a baby!
Not tonight, honey.
I got an early day tomorrow.
Get up.
Come on, let's get some coffee.
Okay, because we never do that.
AII the other pregnant women seem to be going in here.
They're tiny and chubby And so sweet to touch But soon they'll grow up And resent you so much Now they're yelling at you And you don't know why And you cry and you cry And you cry Thanks, Ross.
I'm paying you to stop.
Oh, look, twins.
Hi, guys.
Oh, cute.
No fair!
I don't even have one!
How come they get two?
You'll get one.
When?
Tell you what.
When we're 40, and if neither of us are married what do you say we have one together?
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
I just meant hypothetically.
"Hypothetically," why won't I be married when I'm 40?
What is it?
Is there something unmarriable about me?
Well?
Dear God!
This parachute is a knapsack!
Look at you, dressydress.
Did you go home and change?
It's an important day.
I want to Look nice.
Has Dr. Franzblau been by?
I haven't seen him.
Where is he?
He is supposed to be here.
What if the baby needs him?
What's the deal with you and doctors?
Is your father a doctor?
Yeah.
Why?
No reason.
Mom, we've been through this.
Mom, everything's going fine.
Ross is great.
He's in a whole other place!
No, he's gone.
No, you don't have to fly back.
Really.
What do you mean, "This might be your only chance"?
Would you stop?
I'm only 26.
I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
Where have you been?
I just had a baby.
Mazel tov!
It could be one hour or three.
But relax.
She's doing great.
So tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?
Not at the moment, I'm not.
Are you?
No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.
Right.
Yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.
No, really.
I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know where I do.
I try not to let work affect my personal life.
But it's hard when, when you do what I do.
It's Like.
Well, for instance, what do you do?
I'm a waitress.
Aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day and you're, Like: "If I see one more cup of coffee" .
Gotcha.
I'm gonna check up on your friend.
Okay, got the vent open.
I'm Ben.
I'm hospital worker Ben.
It's Ben to the rescue!
Ben, you ready?
Give me your foot.
On three, Ben.
One, two, three.
Come on, Ben.
That's it, Ben.
What do you see?
I see what appears to be a dark vent.
Wait!
Yes, it is, in fact, a dark vent!
Pheebs, it's open!
It's open!
Wait!
You forgot your legs!
That's what we were off doing.
Unfortunately, most of these little guys won't live to see the 4th of July... ...because, as a result of improper care, they will be dead.
I got you something.
Open it!
Open it!
Okay.
It's a chicken.
It's cute, huh?
You guys, do you know anything about chicks?
Fowl?
No.
Women?
No.
They are a huge responsibility.
Especially at this age.
They require constant care.
They need just the right food and lots and lots of love.
Well, no problem there.
Easy, Lenny.
So, I mean, have you thought about it?
Okay, but this is the last time.
With a chickchick here And a chickchick there Here a chick, there a chick Everywhere a chickchick Chicken Hey.
Hey.
How's she doing?
She?
Yeah, don't you think it's a she?
I don't know.
I can't tell.
Whatever it was went back in too quickly.
Anyway, I gotta go change.
I'm meeting some of the cast for drinks.
Excuse me?
What?
I stayed home while you were at rehearsal... ...so somebody could be here with our chick.
Who was up from 2:00 this morning until 5:00 this morning... ...trying to get her back to sleep?
You don't think I get up when you get up?
Oh, here it comes.
Yes!
Here it comes!
I'm stuck here all day!
And then you come in and spend two seconds with us.
And then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends?
Well, I don't think so, mister!
I need to relax, okay?
I was working all day.
And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?
That's not what I said.
I just meant...
I know what you meant!
Have you noticed that ever since we got this chick... ...we've been fighting a lot more than we used to?
I don't know.
Maybe we weren't ready to have a chick.
I sure want one someday though.
I know.
I know.
I'll take her back tomorrow.
You think we'll get our $3 back?
I know.
See, yes.
That's Yasmine Bleeth.
She's a completely different kind of chick.
I love you both.
But in very different ways.
Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing?
I thought you were gonna take her back today.
I did.
But the store wouldn't take her back.
So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
If they can't find a home for her, they kill her!
I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine.
Okay, good, good, good, because I was kind of having second thoughts too.
Okay, and it's not just chicks.
It's all kinds of other animals.
That's horrible.
You did the right thing, man.
Thanks.
I'm glad you see it that way.
Funny story!
What you doing?
Having a swim.
What about the chick?
Chicks don't swim.
Are you sure?
I don't know.
Should we try?
Sure.
See, I told you.
They don't swim.
Wait, give him a minute.
No!
I said that I think you're hot.
And.. now I'm embarrassed.
I thought you said "hi."
That would've been better.
I'll try that.
Hi, I'm Joey.
I'm Hayley.
Look, I don't normally ask out women that I meet in coffeehouses.
Gesundheit.
But..
This is hard.
I'm kind of shy.
Seriously, you should see someone about that cold.
If it gets much worse, you could die.
Anyway..
Thanks again for letting me have that last piece of cake at the restaurant.
You're welcome again.
I'm gonna go make some coffee.
Can I get you anything?
Do you have any cake?
So this is going pretty good.
Dinner was nice.
We've got a lot in common.
Victoria 's Secret.
We even like the same books.
There's a scary painting.
Wait a minute.
I think I've been scared by that painting before.
You know what?
This whole place looks familiar.
I have definitely been in this apartment.
I know I've seen this weird plant before.
It did that the last time!
Oh, my God.
I've gone out with this girl before.
Yeah!
We had sex on this couch!
And then on that chair, and.. No.
No, we didn't do it here..   which is weird, because it seems like a perfectly good place.
That's why.
Hey, Mike.
So it was really a shock after 25 years of marriage..   my parents getting divorced.
I took it the hardest..    because I was the youngest.
Sure.
Yeah.
How can you not remember me?
What?
How could you not remember that we slept together?
What?
When?
I don't know!
I really, really think I would remember sleeping with you.
Come on, come on.
Search your brain, all right?
It was..   a certain amount of time ago.
I was here.
You were here.
We had sex here, here, here..   Not there.
Anything?
No, it's not ringing any bells.
My God, woman!
How many people have you been with not to remember this?
Hey, Hayley.
We really gotta fix that doorknob.
Joey?
I slept with you!
And you obviously remember me!
Hey, I still got it!
So we're good.
I'll let myself out.
And I said, "Okay, Vikram..   you can't just call every time you get lonely.
Ordinarily, I would talk to her, but my confidence is shaken.
Did I sleep with her?
Did I not sleep with her?
Maybe this is a wakeup call.
You know, about your whole dating attitude.
You're in your 30s and you have never been in a longterm relationship.
Here you go from woman to woman..   meaningless experience to meaningless experience.
Never even worrying that it doesn't turn into something more serious.
You're right.
I love my life!
I actually did sleep with her
So?
Did you read the book?
Oh, my God.
It was incredible!
Didn't it, like, totally speak to you?
What book is this?
You have to read this book.
It's called Be Your Own Wind Keeper.
It's about how women need to become more empowered.
But there's wind.
And the wind can make us goddesses.
Do you know who takes our wind?
Men.
They just take it.
Men just take our wind?
All the time.
Because they are the lightningbearers.
That sounds kind of cool.
It's like The Hobbit.
It is nothing like The Hobbit.
It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had.
Except for Richard.
Richard would never steal your wind.
Because he's yummy.
But all the others.
And the part about how they're always drinking... ...from our pool of inner power.
But God forbid we should take a sip.
Anybody want a cruller?
This is a typical lightningbearer thing.
It's like... ..."Hello.
Who wants one of my phallicshaped mancakes?"
Oh, God!
I mean, it's just so...
Isn't it?
This is like reading about my own life!
This book could have been called Be Your Own Wind Keeper, Rachel!
It wouldn't have sold a million copies... ...but it would've made a nice gift for you.
Sweetie, we've got to go.
No!
Why do we always have to do everything according to your timetable?
Actually, it's the movie theater that has the timetable.
It's so you don't miss the beginning.
This isn't about the movie theater.
This is about you stealing my wind.
You go, girl!
I can't pull that off, can I?
Excuse me, your wind?
Yes, my wind.
How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?
You know I don't... ...have a problem with that.
I just really need to be with myself right now.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
I don't have to apologize.
Sorry.
Damn it!
Question number 28.
"Have you ever allowed a lightningbearer to take your wind?"
I would have to say no.
And I would have to say... What?
Do you not remember the puppet guy?
You totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.
And his puppet too!
Well, at least I didn't let some guy... ...into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date!
Who?
Paul!
Moving on, moving on.
Next question.
Okay, number 29.
"Have you ever betrayed another goddess... ...for a lightningbearer?"
Okay, number 30.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Let's go back to 29.
Not to my recollection.
Danny Arshack, ninth grade.
You know the bottle was pointing at me.
Only because you took up half the circle!
Listen to you two.
It's so sad.
Looks like I'll be going to the goddess meetings alone.
Not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley... ...an hour after he broke up with Monica.
One hour?
You are such a leaf blower!
That is not on the book.
Hey.
And "treat" it is.
Wow.
So glad I changed.
I almost wore my threadbare robe that can't contain my breasts.
This is not what I'm wearing.
I'm ovulating..   and Chandler's gonna be home.
So, I thought we would try before dinner.
Oh, I thought we'd all go over together.
Wait, does this mean you'll be late?
We haven't seen each other in over a week.
We'll probably be the first ones there.
Okay.
See you there.
Happy humping.
Hey.
Well, hey!
Wow, somebody smoked out here?
My God, don't people know you're not allowed to smoke in public spaces?
Actually, in Oklahoma smoking's legal in offices with fewer than 15 people.
Oh, you smoked.
No.
I just happen to know a lot of trivia about smoking in different states.
For example, in Hawaii, cigarettes are called leilanalukus.
Oh, Chandler, you stink of cigarettes!
Do you think Monica will smell it?
Are you kidding?
That woman has the nose of a bloodhound.
And the breasts of a Greek goddess.
Phoebe?
I'm gonna go.
How can you smoke in this day and age?
Have you not seen that ad?
Where the little kid walks through Grandpa?
It's chilling!
I messed up.
It was a meeting.
Everybody was smoking.
So what?
Don't you have any willpower?
Willpower?
I've watched home movies of you eating Ding Dongs..   without taking the tinfoil off!
You said that was sexy!
Okay, look, can we just drop this?
I'm not gonna smoke again.
That's right, because I forbid you to smoke again.
You forbid me?
I've flown a long way to see my loving wife.
Is she here, by the way?
Chandler, don't joke with me.
Okay?
I'm very, very upset right now.
Is this the most upset you could be?
I think so.
Well, then I might as well..   do this.
Not really sure what to do now.
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
We're already late for Phoebe's birthday dinner.
So you're going to put out that cigarette..   we're gonna put this fight on hold, and go have sex.
Fine.
What?
This is the last day I'm ovulating.
If we don't do it..   we're gonna have to wait until next month!
You're serious?
Oh, yeah!
All right, fine, I'll do it, but no talking!
And no cuddling.
And no kissing your neck.
Oh, good!
I hate it when you do that!
And lots of kissing your neck!
Okay, well, the super's not home.
Spend more time with the tie!
That will make a baby.
Look, I can't do this.
I can't make love to you while we're fighting this way.
Oh, sure.
Now you're Mr.
Sensitivity.
But when you wanted to have sex after my uncle's funeral..   That was a celebration of life!
All right, I'm not gonna do this.
Is this the way you want our baby to be conceived?
No, you're right.
We shouldn't do it like this.
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking.
So you had a few cigarettes.
It's not the end of the world.
Really?
Yeah.
You are incredible.
And listen, I'm not gonna smoke again.
And if I do, I promise I will hide it so much better from you.
Want to?
Let's celebrate life!
Okay!
Oh, God.
You are welcome.
You know what?
Let's not talk.
What?
I am still so mad at you for smoking!
But you said you forgave me.
It was just a couple of cigarettes, no big deal.
I was ovulating and you said you wouldn't have sex if we were fighting.
You tricked me to get me into bed?
That's right.
I got mine.
I feel so used.
Hey / Hey  You guys are ready to go?
Not quite.
Monica's still at the salon  and I'm just finishing packing.
Dude!
You're not taking your bible?
You're not supposed to take that.
Besides, it's new testament.
What are you gonna do with it?
Learn about Jesus.
Hey / So... did you talk to Joey?
Oh no, no.
I couldn't find him.
I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.
Okay, sounds like a good idea.
Dr. Geller.
Stop it.
P...h... D.   You're filthy.
Hey, have you guys seen Monica?
Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.
Oh, yeah, oh, she went to the salon, alright.
Check it out!
Whose day just got better?
Ahhh....   What do you think?
I think...
I think I can see your scalp.
Don't you just love it?
Yeah, yeah.
You've got shellfish in your head.
It's, uh..., it's something.
You go girlfriend!
You've never said that in your life, have you?
Not once.
/ I thought so.
And listen to this.
What do you know?
It's a treat for the eyes  ... and the ears!
Wow, it's uh...,  it's kinda weird I'm sitting next to Charlie  after we broke up.
Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these!
Ow!
You go back to work tomorrow night, right?
Yeah  So if you want people to see them,  then by definition  you're not having them taken out,  say at the break of dawn?
Well, if I had them taken out then  I wouldn't be able to do this.
You like that, right?
What are you singing?
It's Bolero from "10".
It's "ride of the Valkyrie's"  from apocalypse now.
See, here's the thing.
The corn rows are  really a solution for your frizzy hair problem.
And now that we're at home  you don't have that problem any more.
So if you think about it, I HATE them.
What?
You said you liked them.
Did I?
Let's refresh.
I believe what I said was  that I could see your scalp.
Fine, so you don't like them.
Everybody else does.
Again, let's journey back.
As I recall, what Rachel said was  she had never noticed the shape of your skull before.
and Joey...  well, Joey didn't realize  there was anything different.
You know what?
I don't care.
I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it.
And you're just jealous  because your hair can't do this.
Honey, you've been in there for a long time.
Is everything okay?
Not really.
I have a problem.
Really?
What happened?
Well..., I was dancing around and  singing "no woman, no cry"   and...
I got stuck.
You can't move at all?
Oh, I can move.
If I entangle you, will you please  get rid of the corn rows?
I guess so.
Some of these look a little frayed.
Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.
Hey / Hi  So did you, uh, did you tell Ross?
Look what I found in the drawer.
And you said I would never wear this.
Now that I entangled you,  how about you do a little something for me?
Sure.
What do you have in mind?
I think you know.
Really?
I don't, I don't really feel like it.
This is what I want to do.
Okay.
I just don't get why you like it so much.
She's an FBI agent posing as a beauty contestant
Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?
I got it from Monica.
She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.
Joey, we're not keeping this!
But it's an original Buffay...  Alright, fine.
You can keep it.
As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.
Hey?
what?
what?
wey!
whoo!
what?
what!?
Well, legend has it Joey, that...  she comes alive when you're asleep.
She climbs out of the frame,  and then drags her halfabody across the floor,  looking for legs to steal.
And then with her one good hand, she slooowly reeaaches up and turns your doorknob.
GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!
Hey!
I sold that to Joey.
Well, why I told him it's haunted.
Two can play at this game.
No, too late.
You can't give it back!
/ Yes I can!
No you can't.
She's yours!
/She's yours!
SHE'S YOURS!
/ She's yours!
Hey!
She's mine!
/She's miine!
You guys!
You guys!
You don't have to fight over her anymore.
Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis.
Ha ha ha, third time this week.
Man, this does not get old.
You're mean!
Oh, don't be such a baby
Why are you still here?
She just broke up with him.
It's time for you to swoop in.
What, now?
Now is when you swoop.
When Paolo walks out of there, you gotta be the first guy she sees.
She's got to know you're everything he's not.
You're like the antiPaolo.
My Catholic friend is right.
She's distraught.
You're there for her.
You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in "The Age of Ross. "
Hold it!
Ascolta!
How's it going?
Don't stare.
She finished throwing his clothes off the balcony.
Now there's just gesturing and armwaving.
That is either, "How could you?"
or "Enormous breasts! "
Here he comes.
I am to say goodbye.
Okay, byebye.
I hate you for what you did to Rachel.
But I still have five of these so heat it at 375 untiI the cheese bubbles.
I just wanna tell you and I think I'd speak for everyone when I say.
Just look at her.
Guys, I think only one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed.
Right.
And I really think it should be me.
You all right?
I've been better.
Come here.
Listen you deserve so much better than him.
I mean, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
What?
I'm so sick of guys!
I don't want to look at another guy.
I don't want to think about another guy.
I don't even want to be near another guy.
Ross, you're so great.
Are you all right?
Are you okay?
Medium.
Any cookies left?
See, Rach, I don't think swearing off guys altogether is the answer.
What you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
I just need to be by myself for a while.
I just gotta figure out what I want.
See, because not all guys out there are gonna be a Paolo.
No, I know.
I know.
And I'm sure your little boy's not gonna grow up to be one.
What?
I'm having a boy?
No.
In fact, you're not having a boy.
I'm having a boy.
Am I having a boy?
You're having a boy!
I'm having a boy!
What?
What is it?
I'm having a boy!
We already knew that!
I'm having a son.
And that would be a shutdown!
I've never had a relationship with that kind of passion.
Where you have to have somebody right there in the middle of a theme park.
It was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
Come on.
He said we were holding up the people behind us.
And you didn't marry him because?
Do you think there are people that go through life never having that kind of?
Probably.
Really?
I'll tell you something.
Passion is way overrated.
Yeah, right.
It is.
Eventually, it kind of burns out.
But hopefully what you're left with is trust and security and.
In my exwife's case, lesbianism.
For all those people who miss out on that passion thing there's other good stuff.
But I don't think that'll be you.
You don't?
I see big passion in your future.
Really?
You do?
I do.
Ross, you're so great.
It's never gonna happen.
What?
You and Rachel.
Why not?
Because you waited too long to make your move and now you're in the "Friend Zone. "
I'm not in the Zone.
No, Ross.
You're mayor of the Zone.
Look, I'm taking my time, all right?
I'm laying the groundwork.
Every day I get a little bit closer to.
Priesthood!
I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking.
If you don't ask her out soon, you'll end up stuck in the Zone forever.
I will, I will.
I'm waiting for the right moment.
What?
What, now?
What's messing you up?
The wine?
The candles?
The moonlight?
You gotta go up to her and say, "Look, Rachel, I think."
I'm account number 7143457.
And I don't know if you got any of that but I would really like a copy of the tape
It's only you.
What are you doing?
Looking at a Playboy.
I want to look too!
Yikes!
Do you think these pictures are trying to tell a story?
Sure.
Like in the case of this young woman... she has lost her clothes.
So she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, "Where are they?"
She's not gonna find them, lying in the grass like that.
Remember the days when you'd go out to the barn...
Lift up your shirt and bend over?
You see, now, I would date this girl.
She's cute, she's outdoorsy.
And she knows how to build a fire.
That'll come in handy.
I got a question.
If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
I don't know.
Me neither.
Rachel.
What?
I don't know.
Me neither.
Why don't you tell them... what you told me about me not being high maintenance.
Monica is a selfsufficient, together lady.
Being with her has been like being on a vacation.
And what may be perceived as high maintenance... is merely attention to detail... and... generosity of spirit.
Wow.
You know what?
That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
Really?
I've heard better.
Wait, he came up with that himself.
Tell them.
I'm out of words.
Should I say it again?
Look, I am not high maintenance!
I am not.
Chandler!
You're a little high maintenance.
You are on my list!
Look, I'm sorry, but you're not.. You're not easygoing, but you're passionate.
And that's good.
And when you get upset about little things, I think I'm pretty good... at making you feel better.
That's good too.
They say you're high maintenance... but it's okay, because I like... maintaining you.
I didn't tell him that.
You're off my list.
I'm off the list.
Phoebe?
It's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend.
I have the best boyfriend.
You know, suddenly I find you very attractive.
How'd the audition go?
I want you to give Joey his job back.
It's not fair that you have to fire..
Okay.
What?
He can have his job back.
That's right, he can have his job back.
Glad we got that all straightened out.
There you go, Joey.
Got your job back.
That's great.
Thanks.
Pretty nice, huh?
Now who's a pushover?
Rach, you're in my seat.
I'm sorry.
I never heard who you'd pick to be your girlfriend.
I'd pick you, Phoebe.
Yeah, definitely you, Phoebe.
Yeah, I kind of thought.
Never.
It would totally be you.
If you had to pick one of the other two to go out with... who would you pick?
No way.
I'm not answering.
Joey.
No way, I'm not answering that
My brother doesn't stay out all night.
Maybe we should check the trash chute.
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
That's right.
He almost could.
Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
Oh, my God!
Where the hell have you been?
Just, you know, out.
Oh, out!
God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there.
What were you doing?
I went to a bar, and then...
...I just walked around for a while.
You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
He hooked up!
He hooked up.
I don't have to answer your questions.
I'm a big boy.
I can do what I want.
He hooked up!
Tell us about her!
Ross, you left your scarf Hey, you guys.
I know what you all are thinking, but Chandler is in Yemen.
I'm a young woman.
I have needs.
I can't wait forever.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
So I'm asking you, please, just take a moment before you judge me.
Nobody's judging you.
Mr. Rightplaceattherighttime... ...call me.
So I guess you finished your book.
I know what you guys are going to say.
You two would have very hairy children.
I didn't know you'd say that.
Ross!
Janice?
All right.
Hold on, hold on.
This is Ross.
He's our friend.
He obviously went crazy.
He obviously lost his mind.
Look, it's not that crazy.
Okay?
But it's Janice!
Janice and I have a lot in common.
We've both been divorced.
We both have kids.
Are you going to see her again?
Don't put ideas in his head!
I will see her.
Thanks.
Actually, I should get going.
You're sure?
I can stay out as late as you want.
I told you I'm on sabbatical from work Yes, yes.
You did.
Oh, man!
What is wrong now?
This isn't what I ordered.
Man!
Can't anything go right in my life?
First, my marriage falls apart, and then I know!
You lose your apartment, you lose your job... ...your exwife gets married so fast!
And now the coffee!
We need to talk.
Sometimes I feel No, no, don't.
I'm going to talk.
I believe... ...that the sun has set... ...on our day in the sun.
You're a very sweet person, Ross.
Unfortunately...
...I just don't think I can take another second of you whining!
Let me make sure I'm hearing this right.
You're ending this with me because...
...I'm too whiny?
So you're saying...
...I've become so whiny... ...that I... ...annoy you... ...Janice.
Well, yeah!
Oh, my God!
Will you be okay?
I am now.
I guess that's two out of three... ...Joey!
I also want you to remember that I let you live here rentfree.
All right.
And I want you to remember that I gave you... ...twentyseven dollars.
This is the boarding call for flight 009.
What are you doing here?
I had to see you before you took off.
You are so sweet.
That's a big candy bar.
I had the most amazing time with you.
Me too.
This is the final boarding call for flight 009.
Well, that's me.
Here, have this.
I'm only allowed one piece of carryon.
Listen, I have to tell you something.
I've been thinking.
I'm just going to say it, okay?
Emily.
Hi.
How was your flight?
It was dreadful.
It was terrible how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
No, that's all right.
I'm just glad you called.
Ross, there's something that I've got to tell you.
There's someone else.
Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
Are we in London?
Why are you here?
You can't be here.
I've come to talk to Ross.
What?
Nothing.
I was going to call him You came to tell him you love him.
I knew it!
I was right!
I'm right, right?
I'd rather talk to him.
I've been to his apartment and he's not there.
I need to talk to him.
Do you know where he is?
Ross, are you there?
Ross, I don't know if you hear this, but I'll talk anyway.
I'm in the States with your sister and friends.
It's all over with Colin.
I came here to tell you that and to tell you Yes, Joey, you can have all the chocolate you want.
I came here to tell you that I love you.
I love you too!
I'll call you right now from the phone booth.
You can't hear me.
I wish I knew if you'd heard me.
I suppose I've given my neighbors a good laugh.
Mrs. Newman, if you're listening, bugger off.
None of your business.
There's not much chance you did hear that.
There's the call waiting... ...so I should go.
Oh, well.
That's kind of nice.
That's kind of a relief.
You want to see if we still have it?
I'm swamped right now.
You're just staring into space.
I'm trying to move that pencil.
This one?
It worked!
Phoebe, this whole apartment thing is a nightmare.
Anything I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak.
Look.
"Wanted: Female roommate, nonsmoker, nonugly."
That's probably some 12yearold kid trying to get girls to call.
There's nothing.
This city is full.
Wait!
Look at this!
"Two bedroom, two bath.
Must be nonsmoker.
Satan worshipers okay."
Yeah, but it's on the ground floor.
Rach, you still looking for a place?
Yeah, why?
This guy, Warren, from the museum is going on a dig for two years.
He's got this great place he needs to sublet.
You interested?
Great!
I'd love to live at Warren's.
I love Warren!
Oh, wait.
Don't thank me.
Thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago... killing, but perfectly preserving, an entire civilization.
Here's Warren's number.
This is great.
I'm gonna call him right now!
Thank you!
Okay, you go call him.
I saw it.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about what you already know but won't admit.
You love her again.
You relove her.
I do not relove her.
I can't believe you won't just admit it.
Promise me you won't do anything stupid.
We're just friends now.
Why would I do anything stupid?
The apartment is already subletted.
It's hopeless.
I'll never find anything.
Live with me.
What?
What?!
What?
Are you serious?
I would love to live with you.
That's great.
Thank you.
I'm just glad I could help you out.
Wow, I'm so happy for you guys.
This is so, so, not stupid.
Ross, you have no idea what this means to me.
I was gonna be homeless.
You just saved me.
You're my hero.
Hero?
I don't know.
Well, all right.
I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has.
Oh, please.
You're gonna say things now, aren't you?
No.
No, I won't.
But I should tell you this.
The same thing happened to my roommate, Denise.
She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her.
He said he didn't love her, but he really did.
And it just blew up.
And that's how she ended up living with me.
Okay, that's a lie.
There's a lot of people interested in the room.
No, but you're mad.
I'm not mad.
I'm just not going.
Right.
Okay.
You know that I have to go, right?
So is it gonna be, like, I'm abandoning you while you're upset?
No.
No?
You're not upset about the yelling.
Right.
And the humiliating.
Well, of course, the humiliating.
So we... ...we're okay?
We're good.
Right.
Honey?
I love you.
Yes, Ross.
Get away from the phone!
She's just getting dressed now.
Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
Okay, buddy boy, here it is.
You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Oh, my God!
That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!
Look at me!
I'm Chandler.
Could I be wearing any more clothes?
Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
It's hot with all this stuff on.
I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
Okay, enough.
Enough with the lunging.
I'm sick of this.
I've had it up to here.
Neither of you can come to the party!
Jeez, what a baby!
Way to ruin it.
I was gonna go get dressed.
The only person I cared about getting dressed... ...is the person who's not even gonna go.
Look, Rach, I'm sorry, okay?
Look, I was a jerk, okay?
I'm sorry I yelled.
I want you there.
I need you there.
What can I do to show you how much I want you to be there?
You could drink the fat.
Welcome to an adult conversation.
No, no, no.
Now wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
That actually sounds interesting.
What?
I think you should drink the fat.
Okay, if that's what it takes to show you how much you mean to me... ...and how much I want you there, that's what I'll do.
Let me get you another glass.
That's been sitting out.
I think this will be fine.
Okay, vanilla milkshake.
Just a vanilla milkshake... ...with chicken bits floating in it.
Cheers.
No, don't!
Okay, okay, I'll go.
I'll go.
You will?
You were really gonna do that.
Well, yeah.
You were gonna drink the fat.
Let's see what else he'll do!
How about you get changed?
Give him his underwear.
I'll get a cab.
I want everyone downstairs in two minutes.
Monica!
Stop it.
Stop it!
Ross went to get a cab, so we... What are you doing?
I think after this, he'll be doing that himself.
Rachel!
You... You look... And I still have about five seconds to spare.
That was about seven seconds.
So we're a little late.
Come on.
Oh, and by the way...  What?
I'm going commando too.
So I said, "Who are you CroMagnum P.I.?"
Dr. Geller?
Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.
What a pleasure.
I was quite impressed with your paper on preCretaceous fossils.
Yes.
It confirmed everything I'd written.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Yes?
Well, you're kind of sitting in my seat.
What do you mean, your seat?
I mean, I was sitting there.
But you got up.
But I never left the room.
But you left the chair area.
That's it.
Give me your underwear
In spite of what may be written on the backs of these chairs.
That guy at the counter's totally checking you out.
Really?
Oh, my God, he's really cute!
Go for it.
Phoebe, I'm engaged.
I'm saying, get his number, just in case.
But if Chandler's in an accident and can't perform sexually... ...he'd want you to take a lover to satisfy needs he'd no longer fulfill.
Can I just tell you something?
I'm very flattered, but I'm engaged.
This is kind of embarrassing.
I actually came over to talk to your friend.
You should be embarrassed.
I thought you knew I looked at you.
I did, but that was really fun.
How'd your date go with Jake?
Great.
We couldn't keep our eyes off each other.
Every once in a while, he'd lean over, stroke my hair, then touch my neck.
Stop it.
You're getting me all tingly.
All I could think of was, is he gonna kiss me?
Did he?
I'm a lady.
I don't kiss and tell.
But this hickey speaks for itself.
Okay, I got it.
I got it.
I like him so much, I feel like I've had 10 drinks today.
I've only had six.
I haven't had that feeling since I first went out with Chandler.
I'll never have that feeling again.
You sound like a guy.
No, a guy would say, "I'll never get to sleep with anyone else."
I'll never sleep with anyone else!
Are you just realizing this now?
No.
Maybe.
Yes!
I'm so busy planning the wedding, I forgot about what I'll give up.
I'll never have a first kiss again.
You'll have a last kiss.
Okay, bye.
All right.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye!
Bye!
I'll miss you!
I'll miss you too!
We said goodbye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
It's okay.
You don't have to tiptoe around me.
I've thought about it.
You know what?
I'm okay, not having that newrelationship feeling.
I miss you already!
I miss you too!
That's great, but I wouldn't trade what I have for that.
I'll be with Chandler the rest of my life.
That makes me happy.
Come sit down.
We're talking about how our relationship's deep... ...and meaningful.
It is, don't you think?
Oh, totally.
Pull my finger.
As we get closer to the wedding... ...is there anything you'd like to share?
Okay.
I think the centerpieces are too big.
You're wrong.
The centerpieces are fine.
Do you ever get scared at all?
Kind of.
They're really big.
Doesn't it freak you out that you'll never be with anybody new again?
What?
I love you so much.
Sometimes it bothers me that I'll never have that feeling.
When you first meet someone... ...and it's new and exciting.
You know that rush?
No, when I first meet somebody... ...it's mostly panic, anxiety and a great deal of sweating.
Okay.
But you're a guy.
Aren't you freaked out that you'll never sleep with anybody else?
Sleeping with somebody, no.
Anxiety, panic and, I'm afraid, even more sweating.
Even with me?
I was dangerously dehydrated the first six months of our relationship.
For me, the rush is knowing that we'll be together the rest of our lives.
Really?
Well, yeah.
Knowing you're having these thoughts, we're back to panic, anxiety and...
...I'll definitely need some kind of sports drink.
Come here.
Oh, you don't have to worry.
Besides, you know what?
I'll have a lot of new things with you.
The first time we buy a house.
Our first kid.
Our first grandkid.
Water.
Water.
Professor Frederickson.
You know that psychic I see?
She told me I'm gonna die this week, so I'm bummed.
I know you don't know about readings, but that's the worst you can get.
That's crazy.
She'd say that to you?
You don't believe her, do you?
I don't know.
She said that I'd have triplets... but she also said one of them would be black.
Just out of curiosity, did she say how you'd go?
She didn't tell me I'd die till the end of the session.
I wasn't gonna waste a whole other hour there!
I've only got a week left.
I've really gotta start living now!
Hey, everyone.
Well, today's my first lecture... and I wanted to try it out on you guys.
Do you mind?
No, that'd be great!
"There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.
Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two..." This is it.
This is what's gonna kill me.
"...subcategories.
The first of these subcategories is.." Are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
No.
Why?
I never seen a guy stare so hard at something that didn't have chicks on it.
"There are three primary theories... concerning sediment flow rate.
Each of these theories... can be further subcategorized... into.." Why don't you open with a joke?
Open with a joke?
It's a university, not a comedy club.
Wait a minute, hold the phone.
You're not talking about Chuckles University?
Come on, we're kidding.
You know what might make it less boring?
Thank you.
Some visual aids.
You know what's a good visual aid?
Don't say naked chicks.
Why not?
I don't even know why I talk to you guys about it.
I'm just gonna do it on my own, with no naked chicks.
That's the way I did it till I was 19.
All right, 20.
Twentythree.
It's so exhausting, waiting for death.
Oh, by the way, do you think you.. What are you doing?
Preparing you for..
Didn't you think I was dead?
Did that not come off?
Yeah, scared the hell out of me.
I thought we'd lost you forever.
You wanna lie down?
Yeah, thanks.
Can you do me a favor?
Wake me up in a couple hours.
You know, if you can.
Did you take these back?
I liked them so much that I bought some for myself.
They're really great, aren't they?
I love them.
Nice try.
How'd the lecture go?
It went great.
And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either.
That's great.
I'm sorry we weren't supportive before.
I knew I just had to let the material speak for itself.
Everyone's all, "Ross, you have to be funny and sexy."
Well, I proved them wrong!
And now I'm gonna pass the news on to Joey and Chandler.
That you're not funny or sexy?
That's right!
Right.
So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory... he made a startling discovery.
What he believed to be igneous was, in fact, sedimentary.
Imagine his consternation when.. Oh, bloody hell.
So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow.
What's the matter?
Fun Bobby.
What?
Isn't he sober?
Oh, he's sober all right.
Turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
All right, here you go, sweetie.
Thanks.
You wanna hear something funny?
Oh, God, yes!
There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
That is funny.
I needed to buy a hammer and I'm out walking around the neighborhood.
And I am walking, and I am walking, and I am walking So you are saying you are walking But apparently... ...there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
And I am walking, and I am walking, and I am walking So you are saying you are walking But apparently... ...there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
So it's help for fat... ...as well as funny.
Don't you have to be at your interview?
Oh, yeah.
See you guys.
Bye... ...ridiculously dull Bobby.
Oh, my God.
No, you let me fin Did Joey say what he was gonna do?
I don't even think he knew.
Would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
Who would I have to sleep with?
Me.
Why with you?
It's my game.
You want the job or not?
Good morning.
Where you going?
Bobby and I are going away for the weekend.
Remember?
What's with all the liquor?
What's going on?
Is Bobby drinking again?
This is not for him.
This is for me.
That way, he's sober but his shoelace stories are more amusing.
God!
Even his knock is boring!
I'll be ready in a second.
Could I talk to you?
Sure.
This is hard for me to say.
You fell off the wagon!
Oh, no, no.
It's about you.
What about me?
I think you may have a drinking problem.
What, these?
No, these are for cuts and scrapes.
Look, I'm not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship.
Oh, shoot.
Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.
Take care.
You too.
Goodbye.
What happened?
We kind of broke up.
Does anybody want these?
I'll take one.
Sometimes I hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
How'd the callback go?
It was unbelievable.
I walked in there and she was all over me.
What did you do?
I couldn't do it.
I didn't want the part that way.
Good for you!
But wait!
I left her office... ...and she caught up with me and offered me a bigger part.
So, and?
So, you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramoray, neurosurgeon... ...recurring in at least four episodes!
All right, I gotta go shower.
I guess you guys heard Rachel dumped me.
Yeah, I'm sorry, man.
She said I remind her too much of somebody.
Any idea who she's talking about?
Oh, I do.
It's Bob Saget.
She hates him.
Hey, Julie!
How are you doing?
I don't know.
It's weird not being with Ross... ...but I guess I'm doing okay.
Actually, I've got some of his stuff that he... Have we met?
What are people think..?
You guys, I love it.
Hey, so where's Ross?
He's downstairs getting the stuff out of the cab.
Is he still mad at us?
Well, you more than me.
But he can't stay too mad at me.
I mean, I just had his baby.
That's not fair.
I can't do that.
I'm not sure you should be here when he comes up.
I didn't think I should be here either.
But somebody said he'd be over it.
Hey, what do I know?
I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
The numbers we're seeing in Chicago, New York and London are solid.
But many of our field offices have reported disappointing yields.
Boston is down.
Atlanta is down.
Houston is down.
I could go on and on.
But instead of boring you..
I'll go straight to my 42point plan.
Walter.
She's just so cute.
I just want to bite her ear off and use it as a sucking candy.
Phoebe.
But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.
Okay.
I put most of the stuff away.
Oh, great.
The pacifiers?
It's in the cupboard.
The burping cloths?
Linen closet.
The diapers?
In the hospital.
Wow, you guys got a hospital?
Fancy.
No, I left the diapers at the hospital.
There's some in the bag, but I'll run out and get some more.
All right, thanks.
Could you stop at the coffeehouse and get me a muffin?
Sure.
What kind?
Let me think.
What do I want?
What do I want?
Please, take your time.
It's an important decision, not like..   say, I don't know, deciding to marry someone.
This is about a muffin.
Blueberry.
Blueberry it is.
Thank you.
Wow, he's not letting this go, is he?
God, how long do you think that's gonna last?
I don't know.
He got over the "We were on a break" thing quickly.
You know what, I can't worry about it right now.
Because I've got the cutie little baby.
I can't believe how much I love her.
I mean, I can't get enough of her.
Like, right now?
I miss her.
I actually miss her.
You know, that's her?
Okay, but the clouds part when she yawns.
God, look at her sleeping.
I love her so much.
I think I'm gonna wake her up.
Rach, no.
You know, you're never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.
Well, I can do whatever I want.
I made her.
Come on, little girl.
Yes.
Hello, Emma.
Hello.
Hi.
Well, I would say I told you so, but she's kind of doing that for me.
I'm sorry.
Mommy's so sorry.
Go back to sleep.
Go back to sleep.
It breaks your heart, doesn't it?
It really does.
How long do you think we have to stay?
Okay, if everyone's onboard, it's settled.
Chandler?
Chandler?
Yeah.
Are you onboard?
Yes.
Well, then problem solved.
Chandler will run our office in Tulsa.
You're gonna love Oklahoma.
All right.
We already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her..
Try this one.
"Go back in time and listen to Phoebe."
All right, here's something.
What?
It says to try holding the baby close to your body..   and then swing her rapidly from side to side.
Okay.
It worked!
No.
Just stopped to throw up a little bit.
It's been hours, and it won't stop crying.
She, Rach.
Not it.
She.
Yeah.
I'm not so sure.
Oh, my God, I'm losing my mind.
Yeah, no kidding.
I'm kidding.
Oh, my God!
You got her to stop crying!
Yes, I did.
I'm Monica, super aunt.
You are the official babycrier stopper.
How you doing, pumpkin?
So it's going well for you two?
I know.
Really well.
I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.
What do you think?
It's great!
When will you ask her?
Tonight.
But don't say anything.
I swear.
I promise.
I'm so excited!
But listen, do not get her flowers, okay?
Because she cries when they die.
Then there's the whole funeral.
I'll see you after work, sweetie.
Okay.
Bye.
So, what movie should we see?
Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!
What?
Really?
He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
I can't believe this.
Right?
Because it's fast.
Because it's so fast.
It's fast.
Relax.
It's Phoebe, not you.
Good for you, Phoebe.
Way to go.
No, but it is fast, isn't it?
I like him, but I'm not ready.
So, what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
I'll just handle it.
I'll ask you to talk to him!
Me?
Why me?
Because you are so afraid of commitment.
You talk to him.
Make him scared like you, make him a man.
I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it'd do.
I'm less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
That is so sweet.
Still terrified.
I'll take care of it.
Hey, ladies.
What are you in here for?
What are you doing here?
I am here to report a crime.
It's a crime that we don't spend time together.
What's up?
You're thinking about moving in with Phoebe, and I thought we should talk.
You know, man to... ...well, me.
Sure, okay.
Are you crazy?
Are you insane?
If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be living together.
I considered that.
It'd make me happy.
You mean scared.
No, I mean happy.
Scared happy.
What are you doing?
I'm trying to open your eyes!
If you live with Phoebe, she is always gonna be there.
You get home, she's there.
You go to bed, she's there.
You wake up and, oh, yes, she's there.
I know.
I can't wait!
Were your parents happy or something?
I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love.
I just want to be around her as much as I can.
When you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, I think I do.
You know what?
Move in with her.
Move in right now.
Maybe I'll move in with Monica.
No, it's too soon for you guys.
You're right about that.
Did you talk to Gary about moving in?
I think you should do it.
He's a great guy and he loves you a lot.
You are a very lucky lady.
You are useless!
Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do... ...and you can't even do that right!
Sorry.
If he asked me, I'd move in with him.
Get out of here, goodfornothing.
Hey, Chandler.
Hey, Gar.
Hey, sweetie.
Can I talk to you for a second?
You look pretty today.
Thanks.
Okay.
Here's the thing.
I really want this relationship to move forward.
If you're not moving forward, you're moving backwards.
No, if you're not moving forward, you're staying still.
And staying still is good.
Watch this.
I want you to move in with me.
That is so sweet.
But don't you think it's too soon?
There's so much we don't know about each other.
Okay.
I get it.
I don't want us to jump into something that we're not ready for.
I don't want to mess up what we have.
I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
Which is why my answer is yes!
Really?
You're so happy.
I dreamed I was drowning... ...and not throwing this ball.
Right this way.
So, how dark do you want to be?
We have 1, 2 , or 3.
Well, uh, I like how you look.
What are you?
Puerto Rican.
Two.
I think of two.
You're gonna face the red light.
When the red light goes on, the spraying's about to start.
So close your eyes.
When the spraying stops, count to five.
Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks and turn around  so we can get your back.
Got it?
Spray, count, pat and turn.
Spray, count, and pat.
Wow!
You catch on quick.
Well, I have a PhD so...    One Mississippi, two Mississippi  Three Mississippi.
Why?
Why?
I'm not finished counting!
You sprayed my front twice!
You never turned?
No, I barely even got to three Mississippi.
Mississippi?
I said count to five.
Mississippilessly?
Well, how , how bad is it?
Not that bad yet  but it keeps getting darker for the next 4 hours.
So how dark is it gonna get ?
Huh.
You've got sprayed with two twos and  I'm a four?
Yeah, but your back's is zero.
You're gonna want to even that out.
/ Really?
You might want to get back in there.
/ Oh, okay!
Wait, wait a minute.
There's no light on the back wall.
How do I know when it's gonna start?
Hello?
Oh, oh, my eyes.
The same thing happened again!
You got two more twos?
I'm an eight!
I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
Was that place ' the Sun'?
Oh, and it gets worse.
Oh my God!
You can do a duet of 'Ebony and Ivory' all by yourself.
How could you mess this up?
It's so easy.
You go into the booth.
You count to five.
And you turn around!
How do you count to five?
One, two, three... / Damn it!
Now let me explain how this works.
You go into the booth and you ...
I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda.
Does it look like this is my first time?
Ah?
Now I want four 2's and  I want them all on my back.
Okay.
Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles.
Which one is it?
Which, which, which, which one is it?
Oh, son of a bitch!
Dude, it's Chandler, let me in.
Go away!
I don't want to see anybody.
I know.
I went to the tanning placen and the same thing happened to me.
You have to let me in.
/ Really?
Did you count Mississippily?
You, you're not tanned.
No.
I just had to get a picture of this.
I'll see you later
Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing.
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.
Okay.
So we'll just stay married.
Yes, exactly.
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller.
Wow, this is so amazing.
I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.
Now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
I'm not kidding.
Look...
...I can't have three failed marriages.
I can't, okay?
I am not gonna be that guy.
Okay?
No, no.
Okay, I know it's a bit crazy.. How is this going to affect you, really?
I mean, you fill some form out once in a while... instead of checking the box "Miss," you check the box that says, "Mrs." It's right next to it.
Okay.
I'm sorry, you're right.
You know what?
We can stay married... because I thought that the boxes were far away from each other.
No, they're right.. Ross!
All right.
Just... please take a moment here... and think about what you're asking of me.
Okay?
I am asking you to do me a favor.
You are asking me to be your wife.
And as my wife, I think you should grant me this favor.
We did make vows.
That kid kicked me really hard.
I know you wanted to talk to me... but I have an idea that may make you wanna stay married.
We register... and you get to keep all the presents.
No, Ross, come on.
No, listen.
I've thought about how to tell you this.
The bottom line, Ross... is we cannot stay married.
I don't know if that's true.. Oh, but it is.
Okay.
You know what this is?
This is a difference of opinion.
When that happens in a marriage.. Ross, come on!
This is not a marriage!
This is the world's worst hangover!
Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will.
All right.
All right, I'll do it.
Thank you.
Hey, hey... is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
There's the train station.
So did everything go all right with the annulment?
Oh, yeah.
No problems.
It's all taken care of.
Ross, thank you.
Do you wanna go see a movie?
Yeah, why not?
Phoebe?
No, thanks.
I've already seen one.
Okay, I'm gonna get my sweater.
You wanna hear something weird?
Always.
I didn't get the annulment.
What?
We're still married.
Don't tell Rachel.
See you later.
It's funny.
The last time Paolo was here, my hair was so much cuter.
All right.
But you have to promise that you will not be all controlly and bossy... ...and all Monica about it.
I promise.
All right, let's see.
Now, some of you are gonna get cut and some of you aren't.
But I promise, none of you will feel a thing.
That's it.
I quit.
What?
I didn't say anything!
But this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person.
This is the face of a person who, you know... ...doesn't trust a person.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
Would you relax?
I know what I am doing.
This is how he wears it.
How who wears it?
Demi Moore.
Demi Moore is not a "he."
Well, he was a "he" in Arthur and in 10.
That's Dudley Moore!
I said I wanted it like Demi Moore!
Oh, my God!
Oh, God!
Oh, my God!
I'm sorry!
Which one is Demi Moore?
She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
She's got gorgeous hair.
I know!
How long do you want the cuffs?
At least as long as I have the pants.
I just got that.
Now we'll do your inseam.
How is she?
It's too soon to tell.
She's resting, which is a good sign.
How's the hair?
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It doesn't look good.
I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
Can we see her?
Your hair looks too good.
It'd upset her.
Ross, you come on in.
Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
I like it.
I do.
I think it's a 10!
Thank you.
My hair is very amused.
Come on, things could be worse.
You could "get caught between the moon and New York City.
I know it's crazy, but it's true."
Thank you.
Well, I gotta go.
I was thinking of doing it shorter, like Andie MacDowell's haircut.
Yeah, I could do that.
Really?
You wanna do it now?
Great!
See you.
I just wanna make really sure this time.
Andie MacDowell is the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
No.
That's Roddy McDowall.
Andie MacDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.
Thank you.
You're welcome
You're welcome a million.
Smell it.
Minty.
I'll be in our room.
Oh, my God!
I know.
I got to go.
I got to go break up with Bonnie.
Here?
Now?
I can't stay here all night.
If I go in there, she'll want to... ...do stuff.
Can't you say you aren't in the mood?
No, she likes that.
Faking sleep doesn't work.
I've woken up many times with her Why am I telling you?
I don't know.
Not every morning Making it worse!
It's over.
Was it awful?
It was long.
I didn't realize how late it was... ...till I saw the five o'clock shadow on her head.
She didn't want to stay.
I called a cab.
She just left.
I wrote you a letter.
Oh, thank you!
I like mail.
It's just some things I've been thinking about.
About us.
Before we even think about us getting back together...
...I need to know how you feel about this stuff.
It's 5:30 in the morning.
So I'd better get cracking on this baby.
I'll be waiting for you.
Come up when you're done.
I'll be up... ...in 18 pages.
Front and back.
Very exciting!
What happened to you?
The One With Rachel's Sister Hey, does anyone have any gum?
I do.
Here.
Sorry.
Oh, you know what?
No.
Wait a second.
Yes?
Hi.
Is Rachel here?
I'm her sister.
Oh, my God, Jill!
Oh, my God, Rachel!
Oh, my God, introduce us.
This is Chandler.
And you know Monica and Ross.
And that's Phoebe.
And that's Joey.
How you doing?
Don't!
Honey, what are you doing here?
Which sister is this?
Is this the spoiled one or the one that bit her?
Daddy cut me off.
Never mind, I got it.
You know what I said?
I said, "I'll hire a lawyer, sue you, take all your money... and cut you off!"
Wow.
What did he say?
That he wouldn't pay for my lawyer.
Then he told me to learn the value of money... from the one daughter he's actually proud of.
Did you hear that?
My dad's proud of me.
My dad's proud of me.
Rach?
Oh, yeah.
Sorry.
Honey, so what did you do that made Dad cut you off?
Okay, I bought a boat.
You bought a boat?
It wasn't for me, it was for a friend.
Boy, did we make friends with the wrong sister.
This is the best thing that could've happened to you.
You've needed to get out on your own.
When I did it, at first I was scared, but then look at me now.
I am the only daughter that Dad is proud of.
This is what you'll do.
You're gonna get a job.
You're gonna get an apartment.
And then you will live off the money that you earn.
It can be you.
And you can stay with us.
Right, Phoebe?
Of course, yeah.
Oh, that's so great!
Okay, I'm really gonna do this.
I don't know how to thank you.
Oh, I like cars.
You all finished?
So, what'd you get?
Oh, well, all right.
Thank you.
I got this, you know, "I want a job" sweater.
And then I got..
These are apartment pants.
Apartment pants?
You've never heard of them?
Of course I've heard of them.
Ross, what'd you get?
I got this...
This.
A pashmina?
Yeah!
I love these babies.
Really?
What's a pashmina?
It's a rug.
Jill?
I'm sorry, Rachel.
You think that's gonna work on me?
I invented that.
Right!
But I am sorry.
It's okay.
One little setback is okay.
But don't let it happen again, okay?
Okay.
Now, since Daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away.
But I'm just gonna take the pashmina.
And the pants.
I'll take it all, because that way, you'll learn the lesson.
Alrighty.
I'm gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner.
She took all my stuff.
Yeah.
Everything but the little blue one.
That's the best one!
Oh, my God.
Thank you so much!
Well, hey.
Oh, my gosh, that was so lame.
Like a pashmina could be a rug.
Oh, yeah?
How about you with the "I'm sorry"?
Shut up!
I wasn't like that at all.
What about what I said about the apartment pants?
How dumb was l?
Were you this cute in high school?
Oh, stop.
No, you stop.
No, you stop.
Why don't I sit here and then you'll both stop it?
I remember my first good one:   "Everything else in Our Townwas terrible.
Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."
Oh, my God!Look at all the newspapers.
I had a lot of water.Can we do this after..?
No, no, no, no, Ross!
We don't have any big stuff we need.
We don't have a changing table or a crib.
We do not have a diaper service.Funny you should mention diapers.
I'm serious.There's nothing to worry about.
There's a baby store on West 10th.We'll go there..   and get everything we need.
Okay?Okay.
Thank you.
That's great.
Where on West 10th?There's a shoe store..
Okay.
If you're gonna do this,then I'm gonna go do that, so..
Wait, Ross!
I'm sorry, one more thing.Yeah.
Our situation, you know,what we mean to each other..   and, I mean, we're having this babytogether and we live together..
Isn't that..?
Isn't that weird?
Well..
I'm just kidding.
You can go pee.
Did we say we were gonna meet hereor at the movie?
I mean, we were seeingeach other a while ago..   but then we were just friends, andthen there was one drunken night..   Or, yes, stranger,we'd like this delivered, please.
Can you fill out this address card?Oh, okay.
You picked out a lot of dinosaurs.Yeah.
That's one of the reasonswhy we're not a couple.
I chose those.
I'm a paleontologist.
Really?
That is so cool.
Don't get too worked up.
It soundslike he's a doctor, but he's not.
No.
I'm fascinated by paleontology.
Have you read the Walter Alvarez book?I teach it in class.
Standing at a cash register, I'mholding a credit card, and I'm bored.
I love your neighborhood.There's a great gym around the corner.
That's my gym.I could tell you work out.
A paleontologist who works out.You're like Indiana Jones.
I am like Indiana Jones.
Hi, Pheebs.Hey!
Oh, how did baby shopping go?
Great!
We got everything we needed.
Oh, and Ross almost gotsomething that wasn't on the list.
A whore.
What?
We were paying, and this saleswoman just started flirting with him.
Can you believe that?
Did she know you two weren't married?Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Well, the idea..A woman flirting with a single man?
We must alert the church elders.No.
You don't understand.You didn't see how brazen she was.
Sounds like you're jealous.No, I'm not.
I just think it's wrong.I mean, here I am, about to pop..   and he's out picking upsome shopgirl at SlutsRUs?
Is that a real place?
Are they hiring?
Hey, Phoebe.
The One With Mrs. Bing Why did I woohoo?
Was I hoping he'd turn around and say "I love that sound.
I must have you now"?
I just wish there was something we could do.
Hello, coma guy.
Get up, you Girl Scout!
Up, up, up!
What are you doing?
Maybe nobody's tried this.
I wish we at least knew his name.
Look at that face.
I mean, even sleeping he looks smart.
I bet he's a lawyer.
Yeah, but the dents in his knuckles mean he's artistic.
Okay.
He's a lawyer who teaches sculpting on the side.
And he can dance!
And he's the kind of guy who, when you're talking, he's listening not saying, "I understand" but really wondering what you look like naked.
I wish all guys could be like him.
I know.
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
Let's see.
"Congress is debating a new deficitreduction bill.
The mayor wants to raise subway fares.
The high today was 45. "
Teams played sports.
What about Glen?
He could be a Glen.
Not special enough.
How about Agamemnon?
Way too special.
I'm famished.
What are you doing here?
Nothing.
I just thought I'd stop by, you know, after that I, you know.
So what are you doing here?
I'm not really here.
I just thought I'd drop these off on the way.
My way.
Do you come here a lot without me?
No, no, no.
Do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
How would I know?
I wasn't here.
Really?
Not even to change his pajamas?
What did you do with him?
You're awake!
Look at you!
How do you feel?
A little woozy, but basically okay.
Gosh, you look good!
I feel good.
Who are you?
Sorry.
I'm Phoebe Buffay.
I'm Monica Geller.
I've been taking care of you.
We both have.
The Etch A Sketch is from you guys?
Actually, from me.
I got you the foot massager.
I shaved you.
I read to you.
I sang.
Well, thanks.
Oh, my pleasure.
You're welcome.
So I guess I'll see you around.
What?
That's it?
"See you around"?
What do you want me to say?
I don't know.
Maybe "That was nice. "
"It meant something to me. "
"I'll call you. "
All right.
I'll call you.
I don't think you mean that.
This is so typical.
You know, we give and we give and we give.
And then we just get nothing back.
And then one day, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around. "
Let's go, Phoebe.
You know what?
We thought you were different.
But I guess it was just the coma.
Yeah, why not?
So are you sorry that I told them?
No.
It's been a long time since your dad and I went running.
Did you get it?
Is Ross here?
He went out for pizza.
Okay, really quick.
That's great!
Very tasteful.
Wanna see mine?
Wanna see mine?
What?
You didn't get one.
Okay.
Well then, what is this?
What are we looking at?
That blue freckle?
That's my tattoo.
That is not a tattoo.
That is a nothing.
I got her in the chair... ...he barely touched her with the needle, she screamed and that was it.
Okay, hi!
For your information, this is exactly what I wanted.
This is a tattoo of the Earth as seen from a great, great distance.
It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.
Oh, what a load of crap!
That is a dot!
Your mother's in heaven going, "Where the hell's my lily, you wuss!"
That is not a tattoo!
This is a tattoo!
You got a tattoo?
Maybe.
But just a little one.
Phoebe got the whole world!
Well, let me see.
Well?
Well, it's really... ...sexy.
I wouldn't have thought it would be, but... ...wow!
Really?
So is it sore?
Or can you do stuff?
I guess.
Save us some pizza.
Get it out of the corner!
You guys will still come visit me, right?
Oh, yeah!
You got the big TV.
We'll be over there all the time.
Except when we are here.
I know you're just moving uptown, but I'll really miss you.
How can you not be across the hall anymore?
Who's gonna eat all of our food and tie up our phone lines Is that my bra?
What are you doing with my bra?
It's not what you think.
We used it to fling water balloons off the roof.
Remember?
Those kids couldn't even get theirs across the street.
Yeah, I remember.
Let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.
You want me to... ...give you a hand with the foosball table?
You keep it.
You need the practice.
Thanks.
So...
...I guess this is it.
Yeah, right.
I guess so.
When am I gonna see you?
I'm guessing tonight at the coffeehouse.
Right.
Yeah.
Okay.
Take care.
Hey, dad.
What are you doing here.
Oh, right, actually, we never got to you.
Can you believe I found it on the second floor?
Who is it?
N.Y.P.D.
Oh, my God!
Just a minute, officer!
I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay.
My God, it's him!
Are you gonna go to jail?
If I go down, you guys go down with me.
Harboring a fugitive?
That's one to three years minimum.
Good luck, Chandler.
Arrest me, but you'll never make it stick and you know it.
I have no choice, it's my job.
You understand, right?
And you understand that I'm calling my lawyer.
And once he puts you on the stand, he'll make you look like a fool!
I don't like looking foolish.
Maybe I don't arrest you today.
Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
I'd love it if I weren't here!
Since you're not going to jail tonight, I was wondering if you'd... ...like to go to dinner with me?
Me?
Ever since you flashed my badge I can't stop thinking about you.
You're the prettiest fake undercover whore I've ever seen.
Nice.
I didn't see that coming.
You're asking me out.
I could've done it better, but these people keep staring at me.
I'd like to go out with you, officer.
Gary.
Gary.
Okay, so it's a date.
I gotta ask you, though.
How'd you find me?
I ran your fingerprints through the computer.
This was listed as your last known address.
Impressive.
Not as impressive as you.
Your record shows you've done some weird stuff.
We'll talk at dinner.
So I'll come by and pick you up?
I can't wait.
Don't worry, I won't just take you out for doughnuts.
He has a gun!
I'd like to return this couch.
I'm not satisfied with it.
You wanna return this couch?
It's cut in half.
That's what I'm telling you.
Did you cut this couch in half?
This couch is cut in half.
I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half.
You're saying this couch was delivered to you like this?
Look, I'm a reasonable man.
I will accept store credit.
I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars.
I will take it
What are you doing?Going over my toast.
I can't wait.
They'll cry so hard,they'll be fighting for breath.
If you want to, I could justhold them down and you could just..   And my veil was lace,made by blind Belgian nuns.
Okay, it's time for the toast.
I know normally Ross gives the toast,but this year I'll do it.
No, it's gonna be great.
Really.
Okay.
Mom, Dad, when I got married..   the thing that made me sure I coulddo it was the example you two set.
For that, and other things,I want to thank you.
I know I probably don'tsay it enough..   but I love you.
When I look around, I'm saddened by thethought of those who could not be here.
Nana, my beloved grandmother,who would so want to be here.
But she can't..   because she's dead.
As is our dog, ChiChi.
I mean, look how cute she is.. was.
Do me a favor,pass this to my parents.
Remember she's dead, okay?Her and Nana, gone.
Wow!
Does anybody remember when..   Debra Winger had to say goodbye toher children in Terms of Endearment?
Didn't see that?
No movie fans?!
You want to hear something sad?
I was watching a 60 Minutespiece on orphans in Romania..   who have been so neglectedthat they were incapable of love.
You people are made of stone!
Here's to Mom and Dad.
Whatever!
Thank you, Monica.That was interesting.
Wasn't it interesting, Jack?Why don't I remember this dog?
Ross?
Why don't you give usyour toast now?
Oh, no, Mom.It's just Monica this year.
You're not saying anything?On our 35th wedding anniversary?
No, of course.
Everybody?
I just wanted to say..   on behalf of my new bride, Rachel..   and myself, that if..   if in 35 years, we're halfas happy as you guys are..   we'll count ourselvesthe luckiest people in the world.
Oh, Ross.
I just wish Nana were aliveto hear Ross' toast.
I give up.
At Mom and Dad's 40th anniversary,you give the speech.
You know, I don't understandwhy they didn't cry.
Come on.That stuff you said about true love?
You were right.
We did learna lot from Mom and Dad.
That picture of ChiChiwith her mischievous grin.
And what you said about Nana?
Yeah,she really would've wanted to be there.
And you know what?
I think she was.
Oh, good God, Ross,how the hell do you do it
I'm here to take care of you.
Okay, I have a wedgie.
That is all you.
What do you want for lunch?
I don't know.
I guess we have to eat.
Yeah, I do.
What's the matter?
I'm bummed the way I left things with Ross.
I wish I didn't lie about work.
He seemed so mad at me.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
If I was still in love with some Still in love with?
Not because I'm in love with him.
I like Ross as much as anyone.
Clearly, I have feelings for him, but they don't mean love.
I mean, do I still have loving feelings for Ross?
Yeah!
I have continuing feelings of love.
But that doesn't mean I'm still in love with him.
I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him.
Oh, my God!
We all know.
We talk about it all the time.
You all know?
Does Ross know?
No!
Ross doesn't know anything.
And you didn't tell me!
We thought you knew.
It's so obvious!
It would be like telling Monica: "Hey, you like things clean."
Or, you know, "Hey, Joey, you're gay."
I can help you get over him.
You can?
I need you to bring me photos of Ross... ...and a small piece of chocolate... ...and a glass of tepid water.
Is this where you throw stuff... ...in a bag with graveyard dirt and hang it from a northfacing tree?
Only if you have the hiccups too.
The chocolate and water are for me.
I didn't feel like getting up.
I'll show you a picture of Ross.
And you remember all the bad things about him.
Focus on his flaws.
I can do that.
I did that while we were going out.
Before we start, I want to say, for the record, I love Ross.
He's such a great guy.
Close your eyes.
Imagine that you're with Ross.
Imagine that you're kissing him.
You're running your hands all over his body.
You run your hands through his hair but Gross!
It's some kind of grease.
I don't know.
His hair never bothered me that much.
It was more crunchy than it was greasy.
This will be harder than I thought.
Let's try some aversion therapy.
Look at the picture.
How do you feel now?
Well, I like you less.
Because I'm going to London.
What?
What do you mean?
I have to tell Ross I love him.
Take care and don't have the babies till I get back.
But what about all the findinghisflaws stuff we've been doing?
You can't go.
Ross loves Emily.
I know, but I have to tell him how I feel.
He deserves all the information to make an informed decision.
You're going because you hope he'll say: "I love you too.
Forget the British chippy."
You think he will?
No, because he's in love with the British chippy!
You're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding.
It's too late!
You missed your chance.
I'm sorry.
This must be hard.
But it's over.
No, it's not over until someone says, "I do."
I do!
I do!
Like I can really chase you.
I'm carrying a litter!
The Waltham residence.
I just got back... ...from Julie's.
No, no.
It's not what you think.
It's the other thing.
Well, what's the other thing?
What do I think?
Well...
He broke up with Julie!
Well, go hug her, for God's sakes!
Really?
Really.
It's always been you, Rach.
Oh, God.
Oh, this is good.
This is really good.
I know.
I know.
It's almost... What do you say we take a walk?
Just us.
Not them.
Let me get my coat.
Okay.
No, hey!
I'll get your coat.
He's going to get my coat.
What?
Nothing!
I saw my name.
What is it?
No, no, see?
See?
It's printing!
Let me see!
Hey, someone order a coat?
Chandler wrote something about me and won't let me see.
He won't?
He won't!
Because isn't that... ...the short story you were writing?
Yes, it is a short story... ...that I was writing.
And I'm in it?
Let me read it.
No!
Come on!
Hey, why don't you read it to her?
All right.
"It was summer.
And it was hot.
Rachel was there.
A lonely gray couch.
'Oh, look! '
cried Ned.
And the kingdom was his forever.
The end!"
That's all you wrote?
You're the worst writer in the world!
This isn't funny anymore.
There's something about me on that paper, and I want to see it.
No, you don't.
All right, fine.
If you guys want to be children, that's fine.
I do not need to see it!
What is this?
That is... What is this?
Thank you.
Good luck.
Okay.
Just remember how crazy I am about you, okay?
"Kind of ditzy"?
"Too into her looks"?
"Spoiled"?
A little spoiled.
He was supposed to type "little," the idiot!
"Just a waitress"?
Now that was...
I mean, as opposed to...
Okay, is this over yet?
Rach?
I do not have chubby ankles!
No!
I Okay, look at the other side.
Look at Julie's column.
"She's not Rachem"?
What the hell's a Rachem?
Is that a stupid paleontology word...
...I wouldn't know, because I'm just a waitress?
Rach, come on!
You're not allergic to anything?
You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that..   after I've buzzed you into the building.
So, Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door?
Those are my shoes.
Well, when you get over this breakup, we need to go shopping.
Look, Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me.
But I'm actually feeling a lot better.
You are?
Yeah, I just kind of want to be alone right now.
Who's that?
I ordered Chinese food.
What are you doing here?
Phoebe called me.
Phoebe!
I'm sorry.
I broke down.
I wanted to see him.
Well, not on my watch.
Damn it, Phoebe, how did you even call him?
There's a speakerphone on the base unit.
Base unit.
Think, Monica, think!
Look, if I want to see Phoebe, and she..
This doesn't concern you!
Sorry.
I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name.
Look, guys, you can't do this.
It's gonna make getting over each other harder.
Not if nothing happens.
Why can't we just hang out as friends?
Sure.
If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join you.
You know, I'm your friend and Mike's friend.
Sit down.
Make room for your friend.
So how have you been?
I've been pretty good.
You look really beautiful.
Thanks.
You look good too.
No, no, no.
This is dangerous territory.
Keep it clean.
So how's the piano playing going?
Actually, I've been playing a lot of love songs lately.
I've missed you.
I've missed you too.
You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up.
And then a pigeon ate it.
All right, you two.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I don't want anything going on while I'm gone.
Here's a few things you can discuss:   Mucus, fungus, and the idea of me and Ross doing it.
I've missed you so much.
I won't ask you to get back together.
I know we want different things, but..    Just to be with you one more night.
I want that too.
But is that gonna make it too hard?
It can't be any harder than this.
I mean, if I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I..
I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you moved.
Everything about you.
If I had known the last time I kissed you would be the last time..
I never would have stopped.
Kiss him, you fool!
What?
Didn't you hear that speech?
If you don't kiss him, then I will.
I missed you so much.
I knew you'd be here!
Crap.
Who is this?
My friend Manny.
I asked him to keep me away from you.
Hey, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe.
Well, you're not doing a very good job.
Excuse me?
What's with the kissing?
Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.
Yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing.
You didn't hear the speech.
I've heard the speech.
If he knew it was gonna be the last time..   Hey, it was very moving.
You're just heartless!
You're weak!
You're weird!
Your pants are undone.
Where'd they go?
Damn it.
Well, we blew it.
I blame myself.
And I blame you too.
Pete, you're back!
Hey, check this out!
Skates!
You're a lot sturdier than Chandler.
He crumbled like a piece of paper.
So how was your trip?
What'd you bring me?
Hotel toiletries from Japan!
These are gonna go in my permanent collection.
You know what that says in English?
Want some coffee?
Yeah, sure.
That'd be great.
Regular or decaf?
Whichever's closest.
So ask me what I did today.
So, what did you do today, Pete?
I bought a restaurant, and I'd like you to be the chef.
What?
Can you believe he offered me a restaurant?
What a jerk.
You want me to kick his ass?
This has been my dream since I got my first EasyBake Oven... ...and opened Easy Monica's Bakery.
I would kill for this job.
I can totally do this job... ...and God knows, I've paid my dues.
But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
You're still not attracted to him at all?
No.
I mean, how could I accept a restaurant from him?
I can't.
I couldn't accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the 7th grade.
But, Mon, that was totally different.
He was your health teacher.
What, honey?
My side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
Oh, God!
Hey, you guys.
Guess what?
Got a job on a riverboat?
You know what?
I didn't wear this suit for a year because you hated it.
You're not my girlfriend anymore, so...
I see.
So this suit is making a point.
Now that you're on your own, you're free to look as stupid as you'd like.
You like it, right?
Absolutely!
I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.
Ross, I'm kidding.
Come here.
What were you gonna tell us?
Yeah.
Was it how you invented the cotton gin?
Okay, goodbye.
I don't believe this!
Look at this refrigerator!
It's gigantic!
I mean, I could live in this thing!
I'd be cold, but I'm always cold!
Oh, my God!
Look at these spider burners!
I love spider burners!
So you like it?
It is so perfect!
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
Did you just smell my hair?
No!
No way!
What?
No.
Oh, God.
What?
You still have feelings for me, don't you?
No, I'm just excited about the restaurant, that's all.
Pete.
Okay, I love you.
Is that so bad?
No, it's not bad.
It's not bad at all.
It's really nice.
The only one who stands to get hurt is me, and I'm okay with that.
You may be okay with getting hurt... ...but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you.
That's why I can't take this job.
What?
We probably shouldn't see each other anymore.
I'm sorry.
Okay, yeah.
I mean, if that's really what you want, okay.
Okay, bye.
I'm sorry things didn't work out...
Shut up for a second... ...and let me just see something.
Now, when you come back, I hope you remember that that chick is not a toy!
Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much.
Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.
Joey, no means no!
I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.
Aww, Rach, I think you look cute And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon  Get away from me I said no!
Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.
You're the most wonderful man.
You put holes in my baby's ears.
Yeah, well, at least now people will know she's a girl!
It's...  it's almost as if people don't want to hear  that their babies are ugly  That's shocking  Oh, it's Ross  Hey, Ross  Hello, Ross  He's rud
The One With Ross's Thing And this is the coffeehouse.
This is where I play my music.
Good deal.
These are my friends.
People?
This is Vince.
Vince, the people.
Vince is a fireman.
Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building?
Ninetyeight hot saves.
Highest on the force.
If Joey and I play with matches, we could get you up to an even 100.
Fire safety is not a joke, son.
You're right.
I know.
Look, I gotta go.
I'm on call tonight.
See you Saturday.
Okay.
He's cute, Pheebs.
But you just started dating that teacher.
Oh, Jason?
We're seeing each other tonight.
Well, Pheebs?
Two dates in one day?
That's so unlike you.
I know, I know.
I'm, like, playing the field.
I'm juggling two guys.
I'm sowing my wild oats.
You know, this kind of, like, oatsowing, fieldplaying juggler.
So do they know about each other?
Does a dog's lips move when he reads?
Okay, no, they don't know.
I won't get rich doing it, but I gotta say, it's cool... ...knowing you're making a difference in a kid's life.
That is so great.
Oh, my God!
We'd better call the fire department.
No!
No!
No.
No.
Well, we don't need a fireman.
We need, like, a good mechanic.
What?
It's probably just low on coolant.
Oh, my God!
Here they come!
We gotta get out of here!
Wait.
Why?
If I wanted to see a fireman, I'd date one.
Crazy underwear Creeping up my butt Crazy underwear Always in a rut Crazy underwear Oh, no.
What is he doing here?
All right, just keep playing.
Keep playing.
You'll get through this.
You'll be fine.
Okay, thank you.
And as always, no one talk to me after the show.
Hey.
I was just passing by and saw you were playing tonight.
It's kind of cool, seeing you up there.
What's going on here?
Who's this guy?
I don't know!
He just started kissing me.
Get him, Vince!
What?
What?
Okay.
I've been dating both of you.
And it's been really horrible because it's been... ...a lot of fun for me.
But I like you both... ...and I didn't know how to choose.
So I'm sorry.
I'm just terrible.
I'm a terrible person.
Phoebe, relax.
It's okay.
I mean... We never said this was exclusive.
Neither did we.
So give yourself a break.
Really?
Yeah.
We haven't been going out that long.
Come on, we haven't even slept together yet.
You haven't?
You have?
Well, this is none of my business.
I can't believe this!
You slept with him?
Well, I made you a candlelight dinner in the park.
You know, Phoebe.
I'm gonna make this real easy for you.
Well, that could have been really awkward.
You made him a candlelight dinner in the park?
Yeah, but I can do that for you.
I'm gonna do that for you.
I can't believe I ever went out with somebody... ...who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooded area!
Everything's gonna be all right.
Who?
David, the scientist guy.
David that I was in love with.
Who went to Russia and broke my heart, David.
Oh, my God!
Say their name enough, they turn around.
Phoebe.
David.
What are you doing?
Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?
I'm just in town for a conference.
God, you look phenomenal.
Well... Yeah.
You look great too.
Did you get a haircut?
Yeah.
Well, I got like 30 of them.
Look, I got a confession to make.
I was hoping to run into you here.
I didn't know if I should call.
I was only in town a few days... ...and I didn't want to intrude on your life.
I really wanted to see you... ...but I didn't know if you wanted to see me.
Of course I would want to see you.
I think about you all the time.
Really?
Because I think about you all the time.
There's a statue in Minsk that reminds me of you so much.
It's actually of Lenin... ...but, you know, at certain angles...
Anyway, do you want to have dinner tonight?
Yes.
Oh, no!
What?
I can't.
I can't believe I have plans.
Can you do it tomorrow?
No, I have to go in a few hours.
I have to be on the redeye.
Listen, next time you're in Minsk... Phoebe?
Can I talk to you for a second?
What are you doing?
I have plans with Joey.
So?
He'll understand.
No, he won't.
And that's not even the point.
I made a whole speech about how you do not cancel plans with friends.
And now just because, potentially, the love of my life... ...returns from Russia for one night...
...I should change my beliefs?
I should change my beliefs!
No.
If I don't have my principles, I don't have anything.
You're so strong.
Or I should rush through dinner with Joey and meet David at 9.
I was about to leave.
I didn't think you were coming.
I wouldn't have missed this.
Well, I'm very glad you're here.
Oh, you're such a gentleman.
Come on, we're going to my place.
I hate this, but I have to go.
I can't miss my flight.
I bet there's another flight to Minsk in... July.
That's really beautiful.
What does it mean?
"Please clean my beakers."
I don't get out of the lab much.
I thought it meant something else.
Yeah, well, I really actually wanted to say... ...that.
But I figured I probably shouldn't because...
...I have to leave.
No, you're right.
Don't say it.
I do, though.
I do too.
Well, bye, Phoebe.
Now's not the time, Joey.
You can yell at me tomorrow.
Wait, no, Pheebs.
I'm not gonna yell at you.
I just started thinking about you and David... ...and I remember how bummed you were the first time he left.
Oh, Pheebs, come here.
Are you okay?
No, I'm not okay.
The only guy I've ever been crazy about is going to Minsk... ...and I may never see him again.
You could always visit him.
Right.
Like they'll let me have a passport.
Anything I can do?
Whatever you need.
Well, now... ...if you achieve distillation of subatomic particles before he does... ...then he could come back.
I could give it a shot.
Oh, look!
I really understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person.
I mean, it's like leaving behind a piece of your heart.
Sandy, that's exactly what it is.
Are you gay?
I'm sorry, that's our Ross.
It's okay.
I get that a lot doing what I do.
But I am straight.
I'm engaged, actually.
Her name's Delia.
That's pretty.
So you're just, like, a guy who's a nanny.
I realize how it's a bit unorthodox for some people.
But I really believe the most satisfying thing you can do with your life..   is take care of a child.
Okay.
Like at my last job.
I met Daniel when he was 3 weeks old.
And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person.
When I left, I said, "I'll see you soon."
And he said to me, "Skadandy?"
That was his name for me.
"I'll see you every day right in.."    It's okay.
Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.
Oh, God, she must need her diaper changed.
I can take care of that, if you want.
That would be great.
Just so you know, these dinosaur toys aren't really ageappropriate.
I love him, I love him, I love him!
Come on.
Rach, he's a guy!
So what?
He's smart.
He's qualified.
Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out.
Because it's weird!
Why?
Wow, I never looked at it that way.
What kind of a job is that for a man?
A nanny?
I mean, it's like if a woman wanted to be..
Yes?
King?
I hope you don't mind.
I used some of my homemade lotion on Emma.
It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream.
It'll dry that rash right up.
Plus, it keeps the hands young.
Yes!
Sandy, you're hired!
That's great!
I'm sorry.
It's just such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family.
Oh, God.
Come here.
You gotta be at least bi.
In New York, it's..   Oh, boy.
Is everything all right?
Oh, yeah.
No, it's fine.
It's fine.
Sandy was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancee..   and it was so beautiful.
Her favorite flower is the camellia.
From the poem..
I can't hear it again!
You know, I can't tell it again!
And I'm fine never having heard it.
Rach, can I see you for a sec?
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Do you realize that man has cried in our apartment three times?
I haven't cried that many times since I moved in!
Come on, Ross, you got a little misty when Ben broke your Iheartfossils mug.
They must have all loved you very much.
Look, Ross, Sandy's just sensitive.
That's all.
Okay, okay.
See, that is the problem.
He is too sensitive.
Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
No, I mean, that guy..
These are amazing!
Sandy made madeleines.
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
What kind of a guy makes delicate French cookies?
They're not even butch, manly cookies with..   You know, with chunks!
Well, you know, I don't know what to say.
I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men.
I gotta tell you, Ross, it's not like you just came in from branding cattle.
Hey, there's sensitive and there's too sensitive.
It lets the boohoos out.
Okay, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
Which one was he?
Pete the Weeper?
Remember the guy that used to cry every time we had sex?
"Oh, was it good for you?"
Well, I'd take a little crying any day over Howard, the "I win" guy!
"I win!
I win! "
I went out with him for two months.
I didn't get to win once!
How do we end up with these jerks?
We're good people.
I don't know.
I think we're like some kind of magnets.
I know I am.
That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
There's more beer, right?
Oh!
You know my friend Abby who shaves her head?
She says to break the badboyfriend cycle you can do a cleansing ritual.
Pheebs, this woman is voluntarily bald.
So we can do it tomorrow night, you guys.
It's Valentine's Day.
It's perfect.
Okay, well, what kind of ritual?
Okay, we can burn the stuff they gave us.
Or?
Or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
Burning's good.
Okay.
So now we need sage branches and the sacramental wine.
All I had is oregano and a Fresca.
That's okay!
All right.
Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
If we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
Can we start throwing things in?
Yeah, okay!
Okay.
Barry's letters.
Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
And I have the receipt from my dinner with.
A picture of Scotty Jared, naked!
Let me see!
He's wearing a sweater.
Okay, and here we have the last of Paolo's grappa.
What do we got there?
A piece of silk boxer shorts some greeting cards what looks like a halfcharred picture of.
Wow!
That guy's hairier than the chief!
You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
It's all right.
Don't explain.
It's not the first boyfriend bonfire to get out of control.
You're our third call tonight.
Really?
Sure.
Valentine's is our busiest night of the year!
I brought you something.
We get off around midnight.
Why don't we pick you up then?
So will you bring the truck?
I'll even let you ring the bell.
We'll see you later.
Bye!
See you later!
Thanks.
See you.
Oh, my God!
See, there you go.
The cleansing worked.
You're right!
They're nice guys!
They're firemen guys!
You tell them you're married?
No way!
My girlfriend doesn't know.
I'm not gonna tell them
You guys don't have this problem, you're made of wood.
Hey, you look great.
Happy Monica's Night.
Well, thank you.
You too.
Can you believe they are actually getting married?
Well, sure, but I get married all the time.
You okay?
Yeah, I guess.
Do you think we'll ever have that?
You mean "we," you and me?
Oh, no, no, no.
"We," you with someone, me with someone.
Good, you scared me a minute.
I know.
Shake it off.
It's just because you and I, we were like a nightmare.
No, but there were some good times.
Absolutely.
Like, there was...
Surely you can think of something.
Just give me a minute.
Oh, well, yes.
I can think of one good thing.
You were always good at the... ...stuff.
I was good at the stuff?
I really liked your hands.
My hands?
Way to go, guys.
You were really good at the stuff too.
Oh, I know.
What are you thinking about?
Just some stuff.
Hey, you know what we never did?
Oh, no, not that.
We never had a bonus night.
A what?
You know, a bonus night.
Two people break up, but they get back together for one night.
One night, just sex?
No strings attached?
Yeah, yeah, we never had that.
No.
Okay, this is getting a little crazy.
I'm sure it would be amazing... ...but I really don't think it would be a good idea.
I really... ...really... ...don't.
Now who will perform the ceremony Who will perform the cer...
How long have we known each other?
Seven, eight..
Eight years.
Wow.
A long time.
But over the past few weeks, I..
Okay!
Sorry about the wait,but it is megajammed in here.
Our specials tonight..   Could you give us a second?Sure.
Second's up!
Not that kind of table.
So you were saying?
I'm not sure.
You asked how long we knew each other,and I said eight years.
Then the waiter came overand cut his tip in half..   and now here we are.
Yeah.
Here we are.
I think I'm falling in love with you.
What?
I'm falling in love with you.
Who are you talking to?
Oh, you're kidding.
It's a joke.
Funny.
It's funny!
I don't get it.
Okay.
Wow.
Okay, so the specials are..   Are you..?
How did..?
When?
Does it really matter?
Wow.
Wow.
It is hot in here.
I know this is a lot.
You don't have to say anything.
You take as much time as you need.
Okay, you gotta say something.
Joey, I love you so much.
But..But.
Joey?
Right.
Hey, that's..   That's okay.
That's fine.
It's pretty much what I was expecting.
It's no big deal, all right?
I think I'm gonna go.Please don't leave like this.
You can't do this to a pregnant woman!
You can't do that,because you're gonna make me..   Oh, there we go!
Can I?Sure.
Oh, Joey.
I don't want to lose..   Hey, hey.
You can't, okay?
Ever.
I'm so sorry.
Please don't be sorry.
Okay?
Don't be sorry.
You know, I was only kidding.
Yeah, that was a real good one.
Is this your table?Yeah.
You'll be here all night.I know.
I haven't even read the specials.
What's the matter?
I don't know.I think maybe one of them is dying.
I kind of hope it's the girl.
The guy is really cute
I'm sorry, there's no record of your reservation in the computer.
That's impossible.
Check again, please.
Check again, please.
I'm sorry, it's not here.
It's not there.
Let me get this straight.
I called to try to cancel my reservation..   was told it's not refundable.
Then we drove six hours all the way up here..    and now we don't have a reservation?
I don't know what to say.
She doesn't know what to say.
Just give us the cheapest room you have.
The only thing we have available is our deluxe suite.
The rate is $600.
That's insane.
It's totally insane.
Dude, let's drive home.
We'll hit all the maplecandy stores on the way back..   and if they're closed, then maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.
Does that room have a closet I can lock him in?
We'll take it.
Great.
They are totally ripping us off!
Dude, don't worry about it.
I know how to make your money back.
This is a nice hotel.
Plenty of amenities.
We just load up on those.
Like those apples.
Instead of taking one..
I take six.
Great.
At $100 an apple, we're there.
Come on, you get the idea.
You know, we'll make our money back in no time.
Dude, you're shaking.
It's the sugar.
Could you hold the apple?
Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206.
I've forgotten a couple of things.
Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room?
Thank you.
Okay, a toothbrush, toothpaste..   razor, mouthwash, deodorant, floss, BandAids, shaving cream, aftershave.
And I feel like I'm forgetting something.
Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already?
Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons.
What'd you get?
USA Today.
Nice.
Put it with the others.
And I also got two more apples.
We're four short of a bushel!
God, I feel so alive.
I love being in the country!
Also, got these great salt and pepper shakers..    from the restaurant.
That's not cool.
Dude, none of this is cool.
Look, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing..   and taking what the hotel owes you.
For example: A hair dryer, no, no.
But shampoos and conditioners, yes, yes.
Now, the salt shaker is off limits.
But the salt..
I wish I'd thought this through.
I think I get what you mean, though.
Like, the lamp is the hotel's..   but the bulbs.. Oh, you already got that.
Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.
Okay, how about this?
No, no, no.
You can't take the remote control.
Yes, but the batteries.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Let's celebrate with some maple candy.
No!
At least tell me where you hid it.
Can I ask you a question?
We hope you enjoyed your stay.
Oh, we did.
And you still have all your lamps.
I didn't factor in the room tax.
Dude, don't worry about it.
I found an unattended maid's cart.
We're way ahead of the game.
Oh, my God.
What?
There's something new in the bowl.
Look, we have enough.
Just walk away.
No, but I want the pine cones.
There's a forest right outside.
It's not the same.
No, look.
She's gonna see us.
No, she won't.
I'm sly.
Okay, go quick.
Thank you for a delightful stay.
My maple candy!
I got you something from Vermont.
Besides tampons and salt?
Oh, my God.
Maple candy.
That's so sweet of you.
That's weird, it's empty.
Hi, you guys.
What's going on?
You guys wanna hang out or..?
Do you guys hear a buzzing
Is there a woman waiting at the bar?
Someone average height, dark hair?
Or perhaps doing a puzzle?
There's a drunk Chinese guy.
Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.
Can I get you another glass of wine?
I don't know if I should.
I don't want to be drunk when I..   go home alone tonight.
Got stood up, huh?
It's no big deal.
It's just a blind date.
Are you worried your date came, saw you and left?
No!
We're okay.
I'm still ovulating.
Oh, good, because as of 4:00 this afternoon, I am not.
I think I'm gonna have the chicken.
I just have to say this.
You're really beautiful.
Wow, that's very sweet.
Thank you.
I'm kind of funnylooking.
What?
Look, I mean, come on..   you're way out of my league.
Everybody in here knows it.
I bet that guy over there is probably saying:   "Why's she out with him?
He must be rich."
Well, I'm not.
Okay.
Well, I guess, then the joke's on him.
What do you think you want to order?
I'm real excited about that chicken.
I'm not funny, either.
So if you were thinking, "Well, he's not that goodlooking..   but maybe we'll have some laughs," that ain't gonna happen.
Well, come on, Steve, let's not rule out nervous laughter.
Hey, now, wait a minute, Phoebe told me..   that you owned your own restaurant.
That's impressive.
I lost it to drugs.
I silkscreen Tshirts now.
Really?
What's that like?
It's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money.
That's right.
I have no money, I'm not funny..
I live in a studio apartment with two other guys.
And I'm pretty sure I'm infertile.
Now, come on.
I've got bad news.
The Chinese guy left.
If it was meant to be, it's meant to be.
Look, you got stood up.
Who cares?
We're gonna show you a good time.
Sit and relax.
In fact, let me bring you a crabcake appetizer on the house.
Wow, free crab cakes?
Well, that's nice.
Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.
Just the crab cakes.
Look..
I think I know the answer to this question, but..   would you like to make love to me?
Really, really not.
It's just as well.
It doesn't work anyway.
All right, well, that's good to know.
Good night, Steve.
Hey, what's wrong?
I just had a rough night.
Crab cake?
Well, what happened?
This is kind of weird to talk to you about this, but..   Monica told me you had a blind date.
Yeah.
I did too.
But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
Oh, no.
Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?
Why does everyone keep saying that?
If it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.
That bad?
Well, he makes Tshirts for a living..   and he thought it would be appropriate to give me..   this.
"Female Body Inspector"?
What size is that?
Oh, good!
Rog is here!
What's the matter with Rog?
Nothing.
It's a little thing.
I hate that guy!
What?
So he was a little analytical.
That's what he does.
Come on, he's not that bad.
That's where you're wrong!
Why would I marry her if I thought on any level that she was a lesbian?
I don't know.
Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
Why?
Why would I?
Why?
I don't know.
Maybe low selfesteem?
Maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling.
Wait!
Go back to that "sibling" thing.
Well, I don't know.
It's conceivable that you sabotaged your marriage so the sibling would be less of a failure in the parents' eyes.
That's ridiculous!
I don't feel guilty for her failures.
So you think I'm a failure?
Isn't he good?
That's not what I was saying.
I thought you were on my side but maybe you were sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd favor you.
I married a lesbian to make you look good!
You're right.
I mean, you're right!
It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace and the Weeble's Cruise Ship which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
That's tough, tough stuff.
Pheebs, if we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta go.
Feel better, okay?
We're gonna be late, sweetie.
Thanks for everything, Mon.
No problem.
It was great seeing you again.
Mon, easy on those cookies, okay?
Remember, they're just food they're not love.
I hate that guy!
How's it going?
Good.
Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
What's going on?
Nothing.
It's just that.
It's Roger.
There's something about.
Basically, we just feel that he's.
We hate that guy!
We hate him!
We're sorry, Pheebs.
Don't you think maybe it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaked you out?
No, I hate him!
No, we hate him!
I'm sorry.
What's wrong, sweetie?
Nothing.
What's wrong?
Come on.
It's nothing.
I'm fine.
It's just.
It's my friends.
They have a liking problem with you in that they don't.
They don't?
But you know they don't see all of the wonderfulness that I see.
They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff.
They think you're a little.
What?
Intense and creepy.
But I don't.
Me, Phoebe.
I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.
You're not?
That's why you're so great.
Actually, it's quite typical behavior when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.
You know, this kind of codependent emotionally stunted sitting in your stupid coffeehouse, with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them.
And you're all like, "Oh, define me!
Define me!
Love me!
I need love! "
Just pickle.
Funny story.
I bumped into Joanna yesterday.
My boss, Joanna?
That must have been awkward.
Actually, she asked me if I wanted a drink.
You didn't say yes to that, did you?
Hello, Rachel.
Well, not at first.
What is she doing here?
Last time you went out with her you said she was a dud!
I judged her too quickly.
This time, we took it to the next level.
Last time I almost got fired.
You must end it.
You must end it now.
It's not an everyday occurrence!
Usually I'm in there by myself.
Promise you will end this now.
I promise.
I'll end it.
Thank you.
It just doesn't feel like we're breaking up.
No, we are.
I'm sad.
Can you wait till tomorrow?
All right.
Unbelievable!
Thanks.
That was my boss.
I have to go.
What are you doing?
I'm getting dressed.
Why?
When I walk outside naked, people throw garbage.
Wait.
I want to show you something.
What is it?
Just a little gag gift somebody gave me.
Put your hands together.
You're not the boss of me.
Yeah, you are.
Saucy!
I'll be back in two minutes.
You're going to leave me like this?
Knowing you're here waiting for me.
I think it's exciting, don't you?
If you don't come back soon... ...there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!
I brought you back a macaroon.
Great.
I'll keep it in my butt with your nose.
That's weird.
She locked the door.
You know why?
She's got the bonus list in there.
I saw her working on it today.
Swear you won't tell.
When Mark left, he gave me a key to her office.
You want to see the list?
How are you?
Hello, Joanna office.
I'm sorry.
I'll be a little longer.
How little?
A couple hours.
This isn't funny.
Get back here now!
I can't!
Why not?
I'm in my boss' car.
What?
Tunnel!
Well, it wasn't that many guys.
If you consider how many guys there actually are... ...it's a very small percentage.
It's not that big a deal.
I was just curious.
Good night.
Good night, Richard.
Good luck, Mon.
Before I tell you, you tell me how many women you've been with.
Two.
Two?
Two?
How is that possible?
I mean... ...have you seen you?
I mean, what can I say?
I was married to Barbara for 30 years, my highschool sweetheart.
Now you.
That's two.
Two it is.
Time for bed.
I'm gonna brush my teeth.
No, wait a minute now!
Come on, it's your turn.
Oh, come on!
You know, I don't need the actual number.
Just a ballpark.
Okay, it is definitely less than a ballpark.
I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.
Tell me about it.
So what's your magic number?
Come on, you know everyone I've been with.
All both of them.
Well, there's you.
Better not be doing these in order.
Billy Dreskin, Pete Carny.
Barry.
Paolo.
Oh, yes, the weenie from Turinie.
Honey, are you jealous of Paolo?
I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.
Really?
Oh, please!
That Paolo thing was barely a relationship.
All it really was was just meaningless, animal sex.
Okay, you know, that sounded so much better in my head.
What about my two?
It just seems like a really small number.
Right.
Don't you have a lot of wild oats to sow?
Or is that what you're doing with me?
Oh, my God!
Am I an oat?
Honey, you are not an oat.
I don't know, I guess I'm just not an oat guy.
I've only slept with women I love.
You've only slept with two people.
Right.
You know I love you too, right?
Now I do.
Ross, please listen to me.
You are so much better for me than Paolo ever was.
You care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.
If I make you laugh, here's an idea.
Invite Paolo to have a romp in the sack... ...and I'll stand in the corner and tell knockknock jokes!
What we have is special!
All Paolo and I ever had was "Animal sex"?
So what are you saying?
There's nothing between us "animal" at all?
There's not even, like, a little animal?
Not even, like... ...chipmunk sex?
Try to hear me, okay?
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It was good with Paolo.
Knockknock.
But what you and I have is so much better.
We have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect.
You know?
I swear.
This is the best...
...I have ever had.
Until now.
He thinks I slept with his exgirlfriend and killed his fish.
Okay, here goes.
Prepare yourselves for some classA flirting.
Okay, hold on.
If you really like this girl, I don't think flirting is the right way You'll see.
What's her name?
Caitlin!
We can't keep eating like this.
It's $12.50.
Do you make the pizzas in one of those woodburning ovens?
No, actually, I think they're gas.
Gas?
Intense.
If this is how all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
You know that smell gas has?
They put that in.
What?
The gas is odorless.
But they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
Well, okay.
A lot of other gas smells.
Oh, the humanity!
Methane smells... You know what?
Actually, I really should go.
But I haven't paid you yet.
That's okay.
You guys have ordered so many that this one's on me.
Was I talking to her about gas?
More so than anything else.
I found it interesting.
I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.
In nine years, she and I will be right there!
I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.
What else do they add smell to?
Caitlin!
Caitlin!
Hi, I'm Rachel.
The people with all the pizza.
Was there a problem?
No, they're fine.
Great pizza.
But, actually, my friend Ross... ...he gets nervous when he's flirting.
Oh, my God!
That was flirting?
What do you think?
I thought Joey was there.
Yeah, no, but just I'm telling you he's worth a shot.
Well, if he's so great why don't you go out with him?
Well, you know, at some point... ...you and I may need to have a longer conversation.
Hey, Ross?
I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway.
You must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
What?
I don't get it, but she wanted me... ...to give you her number.
And she just gave you this?
Rach, thanks.
But I don't need you doing me any favors.
I didn't.
She thought you were cute.
Well, that I can believe.
That's right, Nonnie.
So I called the doctor.
Now we both know the sex of the baby.What?
That's right.The student has become the master.
Ross, I swear.
I don't know.Oh, come on, you know it's a girl.
A what?
You really didn't know?
We're having a girl?No.
That's what you said.No.
You said girl.Yes.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm not!
We're having a girl!
Sometimes I can't believe it's with you,but still, we're having a girl!
I know!
You know what?I'm putting Ruth back on the table.
Yes, we'll have ourselvesa little baby Ruth.
Permission to veto.Yes, please.
Do I smell essential oils?
Yeah.
I'm gonna take a bath.I was just gonna get a magazine.
What do you think you're doing?
Leaving my troubles behind?
I know that you're new at this,but this is unacceptable bath decorum.
It's so hard to carewhen you're this relaxed.
Okay, fine.
You can have the bath,but I am taking your boat.
Now you're just a girl in a tub.
Hi, bubbles.
Manly.
I thought I would drop byand let you know how it went.
You told her?
She pulled it out of me!She's like a conversational wizard!
How did it go?You were wrong.
He doesn't like me.
How would you like it if I sent youto Lee Majors' house..   and I told you he liked youand you went there..   and you found out that he didn't like you.How would you feel?
I don't think I'd care.Really?
Lee Majors is hot.
Hello?We're in the bathroom!
Why?Because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!
What are you guys doing in here?Oh, my God.
A friend he's looking at differently,but it's wrong.
It's Rachel!You like Rachel?
It's no big deal.
Phoebe and I talked.It's a crush.
It'll go away.
Dude, you gotta rearrangeyour bubbles.
Mazel tov.
Ross and I were looking for you.
What are we all doing in here?Oh, my.
Honey, cover it up with the boat.It's not an aircraft carrier.
Hello?
We're all in here,and we'd love for you to join us!
Well, hey!
What's going on?Oh, cool boat.
Oh, no.
Did you tell them?No.
I was waiting for you.
Tell us what?We're having a girl.
Oh, wow!
Really?
I'll get you later.
All right.
It's a new day.And it's just a crush.
That's all.
Just a little crush.
All that worrying I was doing?That was crazy.
Like my friend the bird herewould say, "It was cuckoo!"
Everything's gonna be fine.It's just a crush.
Hi, sweetie.I love you.
It's nice to do this together,isn't it?
Yeah.
And what you're doingfeels so good.
I'm not touching you.
You're not?It's the salts.
Oh, sweet Lord,new realms of pleasure.
Whatever keeps youoff the balcony, big guy
Just now, there was some woman at the coffeehouse smiled at me.
And then the other day on the subway, a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.
Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life.
Oh, she's my girlfriend.
That's not just how we do it here.
I'm gonna take a little break, and when we come back..   we've got Kenneth singing "I Touch Myself."
That was Kenneth with his..   much too literal rendition of "I Touch Myself."
Coming up next, we've got Monica singing "Delta Dawn."
Wait.
I can't sing in front of all these people.
Just pretend they're not even here.
It's okay.
Once that spotlight hits you, it's so bright, you won't see anyone anyway.
Hi, I'm Monica.
And I'm going to be singing "Delta Dawn."
Can you totally see through her shirt?
Like an xray.
Yeah, well, I guess you don't need my help, VictorVictoria.
No, no, no.
I do.
I do.
I need your help.
But, Chandler, I don't know if I can take any more plucking.
It hurt so bad.
Not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe vera and my gentle..   selfloathing touch.
Not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe vera and my gentle..   selfloathing touch.
I'm sorry, the song's over.
Did you see me up there?
Every little bit of you.
I can't believe I sang in front of people and they liked me.
Did you hear that guy shouting, "Look at those tips"?
I mean, did I really help you get a lot of tips?
Sure.
Mon, not that you didn't sound good..  Good?
Didn't you hear them?
I was great!
Thank you so much for making me do this.
That is the best gift ever.
Also a good gift: underwear.
Thank you so much for letting me do this.
For my next song, I think I'll sing something a little more upbeat, all right?
How about the Pointer Sisters' "I'm So Excited"?
And make it bouncy.
Well, you can probably take care of that on your end.
I'm sorry I'm late.
You'll understand when you see Joey.
Honey, you're just in time.
I'm about to sing another song.
Really?
In front of all these people?
And they love me.
Oh, my God.
She gives the people what they want.
All right, watch.
Are those my wife's nipples?
Isn't that funny?
I didn't see that before.
I wouldn't have let her go up again.
I've gotta stop this.
So you'll just touch yourself for anything, then
You know, I'm gonna take off.
So soon?
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, thanks..
Thanks for the beer.
You mean lager?
Yeah.
Good times.
Okay.
All right.
Hello?
Hey, Mike, it's me.
Listen, is.. Is Ross near you?
No, I just left.
And that, right there, is the most interesting conversation I've had all night.
Well, you have to go back in.
What?
Go back?
To the land where time stands still?
I'm so sorry, honey, but..
Okay, Rachel gave this guy her number..   and she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone.
So you have to intercept all his calls.
I can't do that!
He says he can't do that.
Give me the phone.
Hi, Mike.
Hi, listen, I know that this is a lot to ask, but you know what?
If you do this, Phoebe will do anything you want.
Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff.
All right.
Thank you.
Hello?
Hi, I'm sorry about her.
But actually, she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.
All right, I'll do it.
But really, how much dirtier can it get?
Oh, Mike.
Bye.
Hey, buddy.
Hi.
Can I come back in?
Why?
Well, I was just thinking about how much more we have to talk about.
But you left.
I climbed down the fire escape, and you can't put that in the closet?
So, with the exception of the fermentation process..   beer and ale are basically the same thing.
Fascinating, isn't it?
Maybe you should look up "fascinating."
I'll get it!
Hello?
Ross' place.
Mike speaking.
It's for you.
I don't understand what just happened here.
So glad you're back!
So, what did you guys do?
You know, we just drank some beer.
Mike played with the boundaries of normal social conduct.
It's true, I did.
Well, goodbye.
Okay.
Bye.
That was fun, Phoebe.
I know.
It was fun.
See you, guys.
Lock the door!
Lock the door, seriously.
Shoot, I forgot to pay Phoebe for the drinks.
Wait, wait.
Wait, sorry.
Did he call?
Did that guy call?
No, just his mom.
Around 8:30?
Yeah.
Then again at 9:00?
Yeah.
Hello?
No, she's not here right now.
Can I take a message?
Bill from the bar?
Okay, Bill from the bar, I'll make sure she gets your number.
So..
So how was it?
Did you guys..?
You guys have a good time?
We had so much fun.
It felt so good to be out.
Rach?
Yeah?
Never mind.
Hey, you guys.
Hey!
I'll be right back.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Stout.
That's a kind of beer
Come on, baby, don't go.
Please?
What do you say?
It's you.
Just one sec.
I'm going to take this call.
When I continue, I hope that there will appear onstage... ...this magical thing that in the theater we call... ...committing to the moment!
The guy's like a cartoon.
What do you see in him, anyway?
He happens to be brilliant.
Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.
I'm not interested in her sweater.
It's what's underneath her sweater that counts.
And besides, since when do you care who I'm going out with?
I don't care.
Why, do you want me to care?
Do you want me to want you to care?
Do you?
What?
Okay.
I'm afraid to say this, but let's pick it up where we left off.
Come on, baby, don't go.
Please?
What do you say?
I've got no reason to stay.
Stop!
Stop it!
You must stop!
You are bad actors!
This is a terrible play!
I'll see you in the morning.
I can't believe we go on in a week.
Hey, it's gonna be all right.
So since we're getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?
What?
At the place I told you about last night?
Yeah, with the mugpainting.
I was so listening to that.
But you know what?
I need to work on my stuff tonight.
Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Good night.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I guess.
What are we gonna do about the scene?
I don't know.
Maybe if it had more heat.
Well, how do you mean?
Adrianne's looking for a reason to stay, right?
Victor can't just kiss her.
He's gotta...
He's gotta really give her a reason.
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
Or maybe... Maybe he could grab her, and lift her up.
Then Adrianne could wrap her legs around his waist.
She could do that.
Then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest and his stomach.
Then he could use his teeth to undo her dress... ...and bite her!
And then right when the scene ends... ...he could take her with this raw, animal... Something like that?
Yeah.
That's pretty much what I had in mind.
It's a little early to be drinking.
Things finally happened with Kate.
You're kidding?
That's great.
It was so amazing.
After the lovemaking... Oh, my!
...I just watched her sleep for hours.
Just breathing in... ...and breathing out.
And then I knew she was dreaming because her eyes kept going like this: I'm telling you, Joanna's got it all wrong.
I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not.
Did you have a good time  with grandma Greene?
Huh?
Did she give you a bottle of  antidepressants again to use as a rattle?
That was one time, Ross and  they were only like 5 milligrams.
Ooh, hey, Emma,  Daddy has some presents for you, okay?
okay?
I want you to wait right here.
Come here, sweetie.
Huh, Ross,um actually there is something  that I really need to talk to you about.
Ok, shoot.
Okay, um, alright, here's the deal.
Oh, no!
What?
What is it?
Oh, major shampoo explosion!
Ah, look, Ross, this really isn't easy.
Oh, it's all over everything.
Why?
Why me?
Because you took 300 bottles of shampoo?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You were saying?
Well, yeah, ok, it's about me and...  Oh, not another one!
Oh my God!
Oh and this is moisturizer.
It's even harder to clean!
Wait a minute.
I'm not letting you leave  until you tell me what's going on here.
I mean, are you guys  getting back together or something?
She's an FBI agent posing as a beauty contestant
Still can't eat those.
What's so funny?
I'm not laughing.
You told her!
Nancy Thompson's getting fired.
Okay, okay.
I had food poisoning.
It's not like I chose to do it!
It's not like I said, "What would make this ride more fun?"
Right.
You're right, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be laughing.
I should be laying down papers for you.
How could you?
I had to.
We're getting married.
Married couples can't keep secrets.
I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
Dude!
What happened?
Chandler and I are in a bar... Did you not hear me say, "Dude!"?
...and this girl is making eyes at Chandler.
So he goes over to her and after a minute or two I see them kissing.
Now, you're thinking "He's not the type to go to bars and make out with girls."
And you're right.
He's not the type... ...to go to bars and make out with girls.
You kissed a guy?
Oh, my God!
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Oh, Mon, I laughed so hard...
So hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
Whatever, dude.
You kissed a guy.
Joey, do you think your favorite animal says a lot about you?
They canceled Mac and Cheese!
Sorry.
Sorry, Joey.
Why would they do that?
It was a good show, right?
You want to tell secrets?
Okay.
In college... ...Ross used to wear leg warmers.
All right, Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice lookalike contest and won.
Ross came in fourth and cried!
I welled up.
Oh, my God!
Oh, is that funny?
You find that funny?
Maybe Chandler should know your secrets too.
I already told him everything.
You shush!
Once she was sent to bed without dinner... ...so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she'd made.
Ross stayed home every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls.
Monica couldn't tell time until she was 13.
In college, Chandler got drunk... ...and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm.
That was you.
Whatever, dude.
You kissed a guy.
I can't believe this!
You know, in my defense... ...there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.
And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me.
Do you have trouble telling time now?
No.
Quick, what time is it?
Time to kiss a guy?
What are you laughing at, Pampers?
You know when I said married people... ...should share everything and not have any secrets?
Yeah.
Yeah, that was stupid.
Let's not do that.
Absolutely.
I'm on board.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We should keep the stuff we told each other secret from everyone else.
Yeah, definitely.
Okay.
If you'll excuse me...
...I'm gonna hang out with people who don't know the Space Mountain story.
Then I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
Man!
Not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out with the guys at my office.
Hi.
I'm the Holiday Armadillo!
I'm a friend of Santa's... ...and he sent me here to wish you... ...a merry Christmas!
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
Santa was unavailable... ...so close to Christmas.
Come in, have a seat.
You must be exhausted, coming all the way from Texas.
Texas?
That's right, Ben.
I'm Santa's representative... ...for all the Southern states.
And Mexico!
But Santa sent me here... ...to give you these presents, Ben.
Maybe the lady will help me with these presents.
Wow, thanks!
You're welcome, Ben.
Merry Christmas.
And happy Hanukkah!
Are you for Hanukkah too?
Because I'm part Jewish.
You are?
Me too.
Because armadillos also wandered in the desert?
You want to wander in the hall?
Hey, Ben!
What if the Holiday Armadillo... ...told you all about the Festival of Lights?
Cool!
Come on, Ben.
Years and years ago... ...there were these people called... ...the Maccabees!
What are you doing here, Santa?
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben.
What are you doing here... ...Weird Turtle Man?
I'm the Holiday Armadillo... ...your partJewish friend.
You sent me here to give Ben some presents.
Remember?
What?
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?
You bet I did, Ben.
Put her there.
Well, it would have worked this time if his hands weren't so damn small.
...I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah... ...and you're wrecking it.
But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowlful of jelly.
I'm sorry, Chandler, but this is really important to me.
Fine, I'll give the suit back.
Hey, you think you can keep it another night?
Santa?
Really?
Yeah, is that okay?
Did your dad ever dress up like Santa?
No.
All right, it's time... ...for the story of Hanukkah.
Years and years ago... ...there were these people called the Maccabees!
And the miracle was that that little bit of oil... ...that should have lasted just one day, burned for...
Eight whole days.
That's right.
And that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today.
The end.
Awesome.
Yeah.
My favorite part... ...was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
The armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part.
Hey.
Wow!
Looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
Come on, come on.
We're lighting the candles.
I understand why Superman is here... ...but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?
Did you get it?
Joey, will you just come out here and stop being such a baby
And how was the date?
I think there was a restaurant.
I know there was wine.
Actually, Julie's getting a cab.
I just need the cat toys.
Did Monica say... What?
Why are you looking at me like that?
I'm sorry.
I don't know, I...
I feel like I dreamed about you last night... ...but I don't remember.
There they are.
Did we speak on the phone?
Did you call me?
No.
I stayed at Julie's last night.
I haven't even been home yet.
Do you mind if I check my messages?
Oh, yeah, go ahead.
Rach, I got a message from you!
Who's Michael?
Oh, my God!
Ross, no!
Hang up the phone.
Give me the phone!
Give me the You're over me?
Oh, God!
You're  Oh, God.
You're over me?
When were you... ...under me?
Rachel, do you...?
I mean, were you?
What?
Basically... ...lately, I've...
I've sort of had feelings for you.
You've had feelings for me?
So?
You had feelings for me first!
You know about my You know I had You know?
Chandler told me.
When did he?
When did he?
When did he?
When you were in China.
Meeting Julie.
Julie.
That's Oh, God!
I need to lie down.
No, I'm gonna stand.
I'm gonna stand... ...and I'm gonna walk.
I'm walking and I am standing.
Now you're over me?
Are you over me?
That's Julie.
Hi, Julie.
I've got a cab waiting.
I'll be right down!
Wait, so you're going?
Well, okay, I have to.
I can't deal with this right now.
I mean, I've You know, I've got a cab.
I've got a girlfriend.
I'm gonna go get a cat.
I was doing great with Julie before I knew!
Hi, Tag, I have a conference call today, is that correct?
Yes, at 4.
Okay, thank you, that'll be all.
Wait, wait.
Did you see that?
He had no idea... ...there was something going on between us.
I'd better get back to my desk.
Okay, hard worker.
I'll put that in your evaluation.
My what?
You've been here for two months now.
And your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation.
But you know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
Are you serious?
No, I've just always wanted to do that.
Can you help me clean this up?
I'm excited to see if anyone ate my candy.
So did you read your evaluation yet?
No, it was marked "confidential."
I just sent it to human resources.
Please, you're kidding, right?
I wrote that one as a joke for you.
A joke they would appreciate?
I'm thinking, no.
What did you say?
I said you were a good kisser... ...and that I liked your teeny, tiny tushy.
No, not my tushy.
It gets worse.
About your initiative, I wrote: "He was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision."
Under problems with performance, I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not."
And then... And then I drew a little smiley face.
And then a small pornographic sketch.
That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike.
You got a minute?
Yeah, sure, Mr. Zelner.
For you?
Anything.
Minute.
Okay, great.
Abort the plan.
Actually, I'd like to speak to both of you.
Okay.
Well, can we get you anything, Mr. Zelner?
Maybe some chocolates.
No, thanks, but I'll give these to Betty.
So I read your evaluation of Tag.
Or to use his full name, Tag "Sweet Cheeks" Jones?
Is something going on with you two?
Oh, my God, can you imagine if there was?
I mean, what would happen exactly?
Well, I'd be forced to file a report.
I'd have to consult with the legal department.
And your future at the company would be in jeopardy.
Well...  Mr. Zelner...
I filled in that evaluation.
Oh, no...  Yeah, yeah.
I thought it would be funny.
You wrote that you have a cute tushy?
Yes.
I have a weird sense of humor.
And I'm kind of strangely proud of my butt.
It's kind of a risky joke, Tag.
What is this drawing?
I can't figure it out.
It's upside down, you gotta...
It doesn't matter.
It's not like I don't have a sense of humor.
Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick every now and then.
There's a time and a place.
Unless you have a limerick right now.
No?
Okay.
Well, you've got my fax number.
I can't believe you did that.
That was sweet.
Don't worry about it.
You could've lost your job.
Are you kidding me?
With this cute butt, I'd find work.
Thank you, you're great.
Don't be so corny, Ross.
That was the plan.
When I got to it, there was only a few pieces left.
They've come by all day.
They love it.
They love my candy?
Oh, man, I gotta go make more.
Hey, Mon.
Make some more lasagna too.
Something might have happened to a chunk of it.
Ross, the neighbors ate all my candy.
Mine stole my newspaper.
It's like a crime wave.
Pheebs, you got a second?
Sure.
Ever since you told me about that bike...
...I couldn't stop thinking about it.
I mean, everyone should have a first bike, you know?
So... Oh, my God, Ross!
Oh, oh, God... And I love you.
Not that way.
But the bike got you a lot closer.
Well, take it downstairs.
You know, give it a test drive.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
My first bike!
Thank you for the best present I've ever gotten.
You're welcome.
Oh, and Chandler's about to cry.
Am not.
Is there anybody in this building that does not hit on you?
Smokesalot lady.
Oh, wait, that is not true.
So did you read your evaluation yet?
That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike.
When I heard the story, I almost cried.
Almost cried, huh?
Hear that, Chandler?
"Almost" cried.
Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic.
Those two had only each other.
She really likes it, huh?
Oh, yeah.
I saw her walking it down the street.
She had these flowers in the basket.
It was so cute.
I saw her this morning, walking it by the park.
Wait, she was walking the bike?
Both times?
Hey, Pheebs.
Oh, hi!
Hey, so you enjoying the bike?
Oh, so much.
Pheebs, you do know how to ride a bike, don't you?
Of course.
Can we see you ride it?
Okay.
See?
But can we please try it again?
I mean, you were so close, Phoebe.
Well, I would love to... ...but the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
Phoebe.
What?
What the hell?
You know what?
If you won't learn how to ride, then I'm sorry...
...I have to take it back.
What?
Why?
Because it's...
It'd be like you having this guitar... ...and never playing it.
Okay, this guitar wants to be played.
And this bike wants to be ridden.
And if you don't ride it... ...you're killing its spirit.
The bike... ...is dying.
All right.
If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
Great, great.
You're making the bike very happy.
Okay, Ross.
Please don't die!
Oh, hey, don't thank me.
Thank yourself.
You're the one who faced your fears and ultimately overcame them.
Don't be so corny, Ross.
It's not an After School Special
What do you got there?
Just a hearing disability.
What's the score?
1 71 4, Giants.
Three minutes to go in the third.
Beautiful!
Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
Your grandmother would've hated this.
Well, sure.
What with it being her funeral and all.
No, I'd be hearing about why didn't I get the honeyglazed ham.
Or I didn't spend enough on flowers.
If I spent more, she'd say "Why waste your money?
I don't need flowers, I'm dead. "
That sounds like Nana.
Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
I can imagine.
I tell you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, lifeaffirming person she is.
That is a wonder!
So tell me something, Mom.
If you had to do it all over again I mean, if she was here right now would you tell her?
Tell her what?
How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail.
Like your hair, for example.
I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
Would things have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
I think some things are better left unsaid.
I think it's nicer when people just get along.
More wine?
Oh, I think so.
Those earrings look really lovely on you.
Thank you.
They're yours.
Actually, they were Nana's.
Now I'm depressed!
Even more than I was.
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
What?
Rachel, could I see you for a moment?
Okay, here's the situation.
The keys to the cuffs are on the door.
Could you be a doll... ...and grab them and scoot on over here and unlock me?
And on a totally separate subject, that's a lovely pantsuit.
You promised you would break up with her.
I did break up with her!
She just took it really, really well!
Jeopardizing my career never entered your mind?
It did enter my mind.
But then something happened that made it shoot right out.
You got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out.
I can't get myself right out of them.
You must have me confused with the "Amazing Chandler"!
Unlock me!
She could be gone for hours, and I'm cold and... All right!
This is it!
Never see her again.
Never!
Never come in here again.
Fine!
Give me back my Walkman!
I never borrowed it.
Then I lost it.
Buy me one!
You got it!
Here we go!
Come on.
This is great!
Does it hurt?
No, I always see guys do this when handcuffs are taken off.
Hello, sweet pants!
Wait!
What will you tell Joanna?
About what?
She'll see you're gone and know I let you out, and I'll get fired!
I'll tell a lie!
I'm good at lying!
I actually did borrow your Walkman!
She'll know I have a key to her office.
I've got to lock you back up.
I have to get you locked back up.
I'm so going to lose my job!
She's very private about her office!
Now I know why!
You're in trouble either way.
If she sees me locked to this... ...she'll know you were here.
You might as well let me go.
I'll clean your bathroom for a month.
Still won't be clean.
All I want is my freedom.
Foot rubs for a month!
Freedom!
Why won't you hear me!
Sophie, help me!
Sophie, sit!
Would you just calm down?!
I'm going to say this for the last time.
Would you please just There's a lot I didn't know about vomit.
I will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts!
I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
With extra pulp?
Yeah.
I've got it!
You don't have it.
I have so got it!
There will be rumors about this.
No way to stop it.
Sophie, Monica and Phoebe know.
How do they know?
I called them.
When they ask me what I saw...
...I can be very generous... ...or very stingy.
You can tell your friend Chandler we're definitely broken up this time
Hey Honey, wouldn't that be great?
Alright, alright, alright, remember what we talked about.
When we're in a public place, there're certain rules.
That's not what we talked about!
Good to see you, too.
Hi, how are you doing?
Oh my goodness!
They've all gotten so big!
Which one is which again?
Oh, well, ah...  That's uh Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of that lady's purse.
And uh ...  That's uh Chandler climbing on Chandler.
And uh...  That's Leslie throwing bagels at him.
Willing to adopt triplets?........
No!
Ah, Can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross and that's cool but...  if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.
Oh, God.
So adorable.
Look at them sleeping.
They're like angels.
Yeah, I really cherish these moments cause ,   before you know it,  they're gonna be awake again.
Well, they may be a handful but they're so cute.
/ Yeah.
Oh, God Last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing.
I haven't slept in 4 years!
It's, It's a long time.
You just don't know how hard it is , Phoebe.
There're just so many of them.
You know, two I can handle.
Two's great.
You just hold one on each hand.
But what do I do when the third one   runs at me with this bike helmet on.
I've got no more hands to protect my area!
There's 3 of them, Phoebe.
Three.
Yeah, I know Frank.
I counted them   when they were coming out of my area.
Sometimes I think that I ...   Oh, no, no, I can't say.
It's too horrible.
No.
What?
No, no, I can't.
Oh my God , Frank.
Are you thinking of leaving ?
Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them.
Oh, no!
I would never do that!
No!
I was just thinking that, you know...,   maybe you could take one.
What?
You can't separate them.
That's terrible!
Which one?
Okay, this is crazy.
You can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?
Oh, No.
Of course we're not.
/It's insane.
I know!
Alice would never go for it, right?
I don't know.
She's pretty tired, too.
I think we can get her on board.
Oh, just , you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically,   which one would you be willing to give up?
Huh?
Frank Jr. Jr?
You will be getting a really good one.
I mean you know he's really funny.
Like the other day he made up this joke,   What's green and says "hey, I'm a frog."?
Talking frog!
Oh no, you can't have him.
He's so funny.
Well, alright, that's fine.
What about Leslie?
Oh, no, no, not Leslie, no.
She's, she's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet.
Alright, so that leaves Chandler.
Oh, no,no, you can't have Chandler.
No, no, no.
She's my little genius.
I've got big hopes for her.
She's gonna be a doctor or ...realtor.
Wow, Frank.
I think we just ran out of kids.
Oh, I think you're right.
Oh, Wow!
Phoebe, I don't think I can give one of them up.
I mean , you know, they drive me crazy but they're my babies.
I'm sorry, Frank.
I didn't realize things were so bad.
You know?
I'll, I'll help out more.
I can, I can babysit anytime you want.
You name the day, and I'll be there.
How about tomorrow?
Well, that's not good.
But you know I can move some stuff around and I'll be there.
You and Alice just take the whole day together.
Will you do that for us?
Are you kidding?
That's what sisters are for.
Oh, look at them.
Oh, I love you so much.
Oh, crap!
Don't wake up, don't wake up!
You actually did that when you were dancing to the "Chicago" soundtrack.
One more push.Come on, we're almost there.
I'm happy things worked out for usand we're having this baby.
I love you.
I love you too.
I hope it's notan inappropriate time to say..   you're the best sex I've ever had.
That's always appropriate.
Okay, come on, one more push.One more push.
There we go.
Here is your beautiful baby.Congratulations.
I hope you're a better fatherthan you are a friend!
Joey!
What's going on?Come feel my belly.
The baby's kicking for the first time.Really?
Yes.
You know what?
Maybe you..   Maybe you should come to me.I'm not wearing any bottoms.
Oh, my God.
It's unbelievable!
Wow, she is kicking so much.She's like..   Who's that annoyinggirl soccer player?
Mia Hamm?Mia Hamm!
It's amazing.One hand on the sheet, Joe.
Sorry.
Hey, babe.
Ross, the baby's kicking.
What?
It is?
It's not kicking now.
Although we would loveto see you do that again.
When?
What happened?
Last night.
I went into Joey's room,and he was sleeping.
A dreamless sleep.
My God, the baby's kicking.That's great.
I wish I would have been there to feelthe kicking for the first time.
I got some stuff going onif you want to feel.
I'll pass, but you look radiant.
I don't want to miss any more babystuff.
Here's my pager number.
Anytime anything pregnancyrelatedhappens, use it.
I don't care if it's 3 a.m.and you want ice cream.
So?She's fine.
She had Braxton Hicks contractions.Mild discomfort in the uterine wall.
Mild discomfort?
I take it you've hadone of these Braxton thingies?
Everything's normal?Yes.
There's no danger?No.
Contractions can be unnerving,but she's fine.
Thank you, doctor.And thank you for being nice and calm.
I wasn't calm!
I've never beenmore scared in my life.
You said everything was okay.What do I know?
I'm not a doctor.
But everything is okay.
I'm fine.You sure?
Yes.
I got half a mindto contract that doctor's uterus.
Mild discomfort!What's he talking about?
Your page said, "Come tothe hospital."
What happened?
Something calledBraxton Hicks contraction.
That's no big deal.Most women don't feel them.
No uterus, no opinion.
What's with the candy?
I was at the concession standat the movies.
You went to the movies by yourself?Mona!
I gotta go back in there.What's wrong?
I just gotta..No, really, tell me.
What's up?
Look, I forgot my underwear.
Thanks for bringing her to the hospital.
Don't worry about it.
No big deal.
But still, it should have been me.I'm the dad.
Here's information on Braxton Hicks.Thanks.
You did the right thing by bringing her in.
You'll make a wonderful father.
Hey, not as good as this guy.He brought Twizzlers.
I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing.That massage felt so good.
I have to go scream into a pillow.
Bouncy.
Bouncy baby.
Bouncy baby.
Oh, baby, baby.
Oh, baby, baby.
Oh, baby, baby, baby.
Have I gone deaf?
It worked.
Oh, baby, baby, baby.
Oh, baby, baby, baby.
You must be a fireball in bed!
I can't believe it.
She's asleep.
I got her to go to sleep.
I have actual magical powers.
I can hear traffic and birds.
I can hear the voices in my head again.
I'm kidding.
Oh, my God!
That's your new job, day or night.
She starts crying, I need you here.
No, no, no.
Thankfully, you don't need me at all.
So okay.
Hey, super aunt?
See you later.
Rachel?
Let's give it six to eight months.
Okay, so listen, I'm gonna go lay down.
What?
The book says whenever she's sleeping, I should be sleeping.
So..
Thank you.
Hey.
We just got her to go to sleep.
So there can't be any yelling?
No.
We're moving to Tulsa.
What?
I can't..
I can't hear.
Hey.
Hey.
Where have you been?
What happened to you?
I had a little thing with Joey.
If you think this is bad, you should see him.
No, Ross, this is not good.
We have to talk about this Joey thing.
Please sit.
All right, you have got to get over this Joey thing.
Okay?
I never really wanted to marry Joey, okay?
Okay.
You know what I really, really want?
What, Rach?
I wanna sleep.
I wanna eat.
I wanna take a shower.
I mean, before she wakes up, and we gotta do this all over again.
Right.
I mean, because I got news for you.
Emma: not easy.
Well, that's what I'm here for.
You want me to get that?
No, that's really okay.
Monica?
Got it, got it, got it, got it.
See, honey, there's..Don't touch me!
Hi!Hey!
How was Atlantic City?Good.
I brought you back a present.
You didn't have to..   Saltwater taffy?!
Thanks.
Interestingly, it isn't madewith seawater.
It's actually madewith salted fresh water.
That's not interesting.
I think it's interesting.Me too.
I missed you!
Me too.
How was your week?Good.
The baby started kicking.How exciting!
It was amazing.
The only thing is,I wasn't there the first time.
Oh, no.I was missing out on all this stuff.
Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.Yeah, right.
What?Joey cracks me up.
"Have your exwife move in.That wouldn't be awkward."
Imagine, I go away for a few days..   and my boyfriend is livingwith a woman he got pregnant.
So, what'd you tell him?
You didn't tell MonaRachel moved in?
She seemed to thinkit was such a crazy idea.
Plus, she got me taffy.
Really?
I've never had any.Ever?
My mom was too busy planning hersuicide to provide saltwater treats.
Thank you.
Are you gonna tell her?
I will.
I want to butter her up first.
I'm gonna take her to dinner,do all this romantic stuff.
When she thinksI'm the best boyfriend ever..
I'll tell her my pregnantexgirlfriend is living with me.
If I haven't said it before,she's a lucky, lucky lady.
I'm going to pick up Mona.What are you doing tonight?
Oh, I got big Valentine's plans.
I got my Chinese food on the way,and your saltwater taffy.
Interestingly, it isn't madewith seawater..   We actually watchedthe documentary together.
Oh, my Chinese food.I'll get my cash.
Mona?
What are..?Hi!
How are you?
I'm supposed to pick you up.
I made you a Valentine's dinner.Surprise!
Oh!
Hey, Mona!Hi, Rachel.
What's she doing here?
I have no idea.
I'll be watching TVif anybody needs me.
What is she doing?
Lately she just likeshanging out here.
Why?I think she's lonely.
But it's Valentine's Day.Can't we ask her to go?
Well, no, she's way too emotional.
And by emotional, I mean crazy!
That's just my Chinese food.
She has food delivered here?
Yes, she's emotional, but ballsy.
I'm gonna get in my sweatsand eat this in bed.
And you thoughtshe was gonna be in our way!
Open the champagne,and I will be right back.
I've got a surprise.You got another exwife back there?
Please start drinking.
I'm just gonna grab the phone.Rachel, wait.
I hope you don't take thisthe wrong way.
What are you doing?Do you need the phone?
No.
Ross is too nice to say it,but this is his apartment.
We need boundaries, so why don'tyou go back to your place.
But, Mona, I live here.
But I can't do anything about it.
Why not?
So close.
Hey, everybody!
Hi, there.
This is Elizabeth.
Hi, Elizabeth.
I'm the student.
Isn't she cute?
Nope.
Weren't you guys supposed to... not be seen together?
We aren't.
We just happen to have run into each other here.
This is... Oh, sly!
I wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run.
See you later?
Okay.
Bye, Ross.
Bye.
See you.
Didn't mean to run into you, sir.
That's quite all right, ma'am.
Bye.
Why is she leaving?
Is it a school night and she has homework?
Yes.
Her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
Tell her good luck with that.
Anyone else?
Bring them on.
When's her birthday?
I don't know.
Why?
It's just been so long since I've been to Chuck E. Cheese.
I like Elizabeth.
Well, thanks.
I like her so much, tell her I want my cookies early this year.
A box of Thin Mints and some Tagalongs.
Give him a break.
Ross, how's it going with her?
It's been great.
She's 20, so she's not too serious, which is perfect for me now.
That's great.
Seriously, she seems nice.
I know you guys like to give me a hard time... but it means a lot to me.
Just knowing..
Okay, I got a good one.
I'm not talking to you!
You broke my fridge!
You wanted to see me, Professor Geller?
Yes.
Please come in.
Doorknob?
Yeah.
It kind of grows on you.
I wanted to finish talking to you about spring vacation.
Good.
Look, I... Look, I'm having a great time with you.
And I just don't want us to move too fast or put too much pressure on us.
So I'm sorry, I just don't think we should go away together yet.
It's too soon.
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying.
I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.
No.
I think you misunderstood what I was saying.
What I meant was.. You are so adorable.
That.
Let's talk about that.
I'm so glad you're going on this trip.
I've been working so hard this semester.
I really need to go crazy, blow off some steam.
Sure.
Look, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet, but...
I know a great way to blow off steam.
What?
Are you into crafts at all?
Ross, are you okay?
Yeah.
Of course I'm okay.
I'm just being supportive.
Supportive of you and this whole trip... and what's this?
It's a bathing suit?
To wear in front of people?
Is that supportive?
Is this?
Okay, good.
Sorry for pushing those guys on you.
That's all right.
I ended up having a really good time.
The charity was a big success, and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
So, what was it for anyway?
I wanna say a disease.
I just got this really weird message from Ross.
He said to turn on MTV.
Oh, my God, look!
To be 13 again..
You know how when you're wearing pants and you lean forward...
...I check out your underwear?
Well, when Jake did it...
...I saw that he was wearing women's underwear.
I know.
They were mine.
Oh!
No, no, wait.
That's weird.
We were goofing around, and I dared him to try them on.
That's weird!
I'm wearing his briefs right now.
That's kind of hot.
I think so too.
And that little flap?
It's great for holding my lipstick.
I wouldn't know about that.
Jake says that women's underwear is actually more comfortable.
He loves how silk feels against his skin.
Next he'll say your high heels are good for his posture.
There's nothing wrong with Jake.
He is all man.
I think more than you.
He looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacies.
I'm just saying only a man completely secure in his masculinity... ...could wear women's underwear.
I don't think you could.
I am secure with my masculinity.
Okay, whatever.
You've seen my huge stack of porn, right?
Hey, Rach, come on.
Come on!
I'm sure we won't get arrested for this.
God!
Hi, officer.
Hey, Pheebs.
Hey.
Check it out.
How much of a man am I?
Wow, nice.
Manly, and also kind of a slut.
I'm beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
The silk feels really good.
And things aren't as smashed down as I thought they would be.
That's great.
You have so many more choices than with men's underwear.
Bikini, French cut, thong.
And the fabrics: Cotton, silk, lace.
You know what I've always wondered about?
Pantyhose!
The way they start at your toe, then they go all the way up to...
I should go take these off, shouldn't I?
I think it's important you do.
You feel better?
Yeah.
Much.
Listen... Not that I'm insecure about my manhood or anything... ...but I think I need to hook up with a woman right now.
I understand.
You look familiar.
Do I know you?
I don't think so.
Maybe it's because I'm on television.
I'm an actor on Days of our Lives.
Wow.
Really?
$4.50, please.
Oh, let me get this.
These are for you
What, now you're not even talking to me?
Look, Rachel, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I was out of my mind.
I thought I'd lost you.
How insane must I have been to do something like this?
I don't cheat, right?
That's not me.
I'm not Joey!
Yeah, okay.
Hey!
It's 3 in the morning.
They don't know that I've come home yet.
You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am?
Yeah, you know, people can be so selfinvolved.
You know what?
I'm not the one that wanted that break, okay?
You're the one that bailed on us.
You're the one... ...that ran the moment things got a little rough.
That's...  That's what?
That is neither here nor there.
Here we are... ...in a tough spot again.
What do you want?
How do you want to handle it?
You want to fight for us or bail?
Look, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing, okay?
And I'm sorry.
I wish I could take it back, but I can't.
I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good.
Rachel, I love you so much.
No, Ross!
Don't!
You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away.
It doesn't work that way.
It doesn't just make it better.
Okay.
Okay.
I think you should go.
What?
I really think you need to go now.
Okay.
Okay.
This morning you said there was nothing so big we couldn't work past it.
What the hell did I know?
There's got to be a way we can work past this.
I can't imagine my life without you.
You know?
Without...
Without these arms... ...and your face and heart... ...your good heart, Rach, and... No.
I can't.
You're a totally different person to me now.
I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me.
Ever.
God, and now I can't stop picturing you with her.
I can't.
It doesn't matter what you say or what you do.
It's just changed everything.
Forever.
This can't be it.
Then how come it is?
Big ring!
Why did you fill your father's head with that garbage about making things right?
Things were fine the way they were!
There's chicken in there.
Put it away.
For God's sake, Joey!
Really.
Hold on.
You knew?
Of course I knew.
What do you think?
Your father is no James Bond.
You should have heard his cover stories.
"I'm sleeping over at my accountant's. "
I mean, what is that?
Please!
So then, how could you?
Do you remember how your father used to be?
Always yelling.
Nothing made him happy.
Not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle.
Now he's happy.
I mean, it's nice.
He has a hobby.
Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but what the hell are you saying?
I mean, what about you?
Me?
I'm fine.
Look, honey in an ideal world there'd be no her and your father would look like Sting.
And I'll tell you something else: Ever since that poodlestuffer came along he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive.
He's been more loving.
It's like every day is our anniversary.
I'm happy for you?
Well, don't be!
Because now everything's screwed up.
I just want it the way it was.
Ma, I'm sorry.
I just did what I thought you'd want.
I know you did, cookie.
I know you did.
So tell me.
Did you see her?
You're ten times prettier than she is.
That's sweet.
Could I take her?
With this ring, no contest!
What's wrong, sweetie?
So you talked to your dad?
He's gonna keep cheating on Ma, like she wanted.
Ma's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know.
And my sister Tina can't see her husband anymore because he got a restraining order.
Which has nothing to do with it, except that I found out today.
Things have changed here on Walton's mountain.
So Joey, are you okay?
Yeah, I guess.
It's just.
You know, they're parents.
After a certain point, you gotta let go.
Even if you know better you gotta let them make their own mistakes.
And just think in a few years, we'll turn into them.
Oh, please!
If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after 20yearold boys or I'll end up like my mom!
How's it going?
Okay, except I broke up with Roger.
Yeah, right!
What happened?
I don't know.
I mean.
He's a good person and he can be really sweet.
And in some ways, I think he is so right for me.
It's just.
I hate that guy!
What's going on?
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express.
Next stop, Rachel Greene.
Joey, what the hell were you doing?
Sorry, wrong boobies!
Hello, Joey!
Hello, dear
Hi, honey.
We're all here.
We want to wish you a merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas.
I miss you guys.
So is it horrible?
Is everybody working really hard?
Well, no, it's just me and Wendy.
Wendy?
That sounds like a girl's name.
It is.
Did I not tell you about her?
About the time you told me about New Year's Eve.
Where's everybody else?
I sent them home.
You are such a good boss.
Is she pretty?
Answer faster.
Answer faster.
I don't know.
Answer better.
Answer better.
I don't think of her that way.
I mean, she's a colleague.
What does she do there?
She's regional vice president.
She's just below me.
She did what?
Below me.
Wait, is Wendy the runnerup Miss Oklahoma?
What?!
Well, she didn't win.
All right, maybe I should let you..   and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.
Second prettiest that year.
Of all the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably..   Chandler, stop talking.
Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.
Okay.
I'm serious.
Okay.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, you guys.
Merry Christmas.
The wife says hi.
Fun conversation?
Well, she's just got this weird idea that..   because you and I are alone something's gonna happen.
Really?
Would that be so terrible?
This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about..   but you're getting ham on my only tie.
Wait a minute.
Am I sexy in Oklahoma?
You are to me.
No.
No.
No!
Look, I'm married.
So?
I'm married.
I'm happily married.
What's that like?
Right.
So I'm sorry, but..
Seriously?
Happily married?
So that phone call before, that was happy?
Well, look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart.
She's entitled to be a little paranoid.
Or, in this case, right on the money.
You know, she's amazing and beautiful and smart.
And if she were here right now, she'd kick your ass.
Look, you're a really nice person, hamstealing and adultery aside.
But what I have with my wife is pretty great.
So nothing's ever gonna happen between us.
Okay, let me ask you something.
If what you and your wife have is so great..   then why are you spending Christmas with me?
You were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight.
I love it!
Really?
You're not gonna return it?
Well, not this second.
Hey, look, you guys.
It's snowing!
Wow, it's so beautiful.
Wow, it really is.
Wendy's a fatgirl name.
Aren't we done with that?
Okay, fine.
Fine.
Let's talk about snow.
Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa where my husband's having sex on a copier?
Hey.
Oh, my God.
Look at that.
That's a Christmas miracle!
What are you doing here?
I wanted to be with you.
I missed you so much.
Hey, hey.
Who'd you miss the most?
Monica.
Gotcha.
I never want to leave you again.
I thought if you left, you'd get fired.
Turns out they can't fire me.
Because I quit.
What?
What?
You..?
You really quit your job?
Yeah.
It was a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you.
Why should I be the only one who doesn't do what he really wants to do?
Well, what do you really wanna do?
I have not thought this through.
Honey, here's 20 bucks.
I need to talk to you.
Sure.
What's up?
Oh, sorry.
I meant Chandler.
I know.
Well, if something comes up...
I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
My boss.
Joanna.
When you left... ...she started asking questions about you...
Liked what she saw?
Dug my action, did she?
Checking out the Chan Chan Man!
That was... ...surreal.
What do you think?
Are you interested at all?
Yeah.
She seemed cool.
Attractive.
I'll do it.
Thank you.
This is so great.
She's gonna love me.
Hey, my father's house does that.
Okay.
How did it go?
Tell me everything!
The movie was great... ...dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
Of course, I didn't enjoy any of that because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!
Chandler is fantastic!
What?
We click!
You know how people click?
He came by to pick me up, I opened the door and it was just like, "click!"
Did he tell you?
He's got such a good heart.
Doesn't he have a good heart?
And he's so sweet.
He said he'd call, so put him straight through.
Isn't this great?
Don't spoil it.
Call her.
Call her now!
Multiple so many paper cuts.
"Why hasn't he called, Rachel?
Why, why?
I don't understand!
He said he'd call.
Why?"
I'm telling you, she's flipped out!
She's gone crazy!
Well, give me the phone then.
This isn't funny.
She thinks it's my fault you haven't called.
You have to call her.
Look... ...you can't call somebody after this long to say: "In case you didn't notice, I don't like you."
Then you'll have to take her out again.
No!
She's really dull, and she gets this... ...gross mascaragoop thing in the corner of her eye!
I don't care!
You're gonna have to take her out again and end it.
And end it in a way that she knows it's actually ended.
I don't care how hard it is.
Don't tell her you'll call her again!
All right, fine!
But it's just a lunch date.
No more than an hour.
From now on, I get my own dates.
I don't want you setting me up again!
No, and there's really no reason why he should find out.
So let's not make a big deal out of it, okay?
It's right here, and it's all the time.
Well, thanks again for lunch.
Yes.
This was pleasant.
It was, wasn't it?
The food there was great.
Wasn't it?
So take care.
You too.
This was great.
I'll give you a call.
We should do it again!
Great.
I'm looking forward to it.
Rachel, any messages?
Sophie's desk.
Are you gonna call her?
No.
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm weak and pathetic and sorry.
You are gonna tell her.
You'll tell her now.
I'm not gonna call you.
What?
I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not.
Look, this has nothing to do with you.
And this isn't Rachel's fault.
It's me.
I have serious problems when it comes to women.
I have issues with commitment, intimacy... ...mascara goop.
I'm really sorry.
It's just that this isn't going to work out.
Well, this isn't how I was hoping this would end... ...but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.
Yeah.
Okay.
So...
This is great.
I'll give you a call.
We should do it again!
Hi, Mrs. Laurio.

Do you have to do that?
It's Saturday!
Oh, come on!
Morning's here!
I hate this apartment!
I hate this wall color!
I hate that it still smells like bird!
I hate that singing guy!
Are you kidding?
I love that guy!
Morning's here Stop it!
I will kill you.
I hate that my room is so small.
I have all the space I need.
Do what I did.
You don't even have a bed.
You sleep in a ball on the floor!
I am tired of your bellyaching.
I've worked hard to make this a nice place for us.
I know.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, okay?
It's a great apartment!
Shut up!
This place is a hole!
The One with All the Haste I still can't believe you've got an earring!
Those were, like, the best seats ever!
Should we give these to the girls?
Like a peace offering?
That's very nice.
Plus, they were free and too small.
Oh, God!
Hey, you want a beer?
I know!
Open up!
Open up!
Open up!
We'll discuss it in the morning.
What the hell is going on?
We took our apartment back!
I had nothing to do with it.
Okay, it was my idea.
But I don't feel good about it.
We are switching back right now.
No, we're not.
We're not leaving!
You'll have to.
You both have jobs.
As soon as you do, we'll switch back!
You can't stop us.
Right, Joe?
I don't know.
What?
I don't want to move again, with...
This is our apartment and they stole You stole!
Our apartment!
We won it fair and square.
Twice!
And I am getting it back right now!
I'm getting it back right now!
All right.
We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
No more offers.
You can't offer anything to us!
Let us keep the apartment and As a thank you... ...Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
Totally worth it!
That was one good minute!
Good night.
Men are such idiots.
I know.
Can you believe something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
If you had just done that after the last contest... ...no one would have had to move at all.
Let's pretend that's not true.
Scarf's done.
Come on, come on!
Morning's here The morning's here Sunshine is here The sky is clear The morning's here Hey, you're back!
Hey, get into gear Breakfast is near The dark of night has disappeared I'll see you tomorrow morning
That's right.
I love you.
And I'm gonna play with youall the time.
How can you let him talkto your crotch like that?
He's talking to the baby.Oh!
Okay.
Okay, because when he said,"l can't wait for your first words"..
I thought, "There's a trick."
Well, I gotta go, you guys.I'll see you later.
Okay.
Bye.Bye.
Hey, listen.
Can you do me a favor?
Mysister knows you work at Ralph Lauren..
Forget it.
No way.
I am not sendingmore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison.
It is a waste.No, not her.
My youngest sister, Dina,is interested in fashion.
She wants to talk to someone successfulto give her some advice.
I guess I could talk to my supervisors.No, she wants to talk to you.
Really?
Oh, my God.
I'm successful.
Okay, so would you meet with her?Yes, I'd love to.
Have her come by.
Great, thanks.
You'll love her.
She's thesmartest of all the Tribbiani children.
Yeah, you know the SATs?Yeah.
She took them.
Here she is: future fashion superstar.
Oh, Joey, I'm hardly..My little sister Dina.
Hi, Dina.
Nice to meet you.Hi.
Thanks so much for meeting with me.Joey's told me so much about you.
This is so exciting for her.
Because he likes it sometimeswhen the buttons light up.
Well, I'll let you two "fashists"get down to business.
You, be good, learn a lot.
Okay.
All right, Dina.
Well, let's talk about the differentareas of fashion..   that you could get involved in.
Let's see, there's design.
But you mayneed a whole other degree for that.
Sales is great.
You get to travel.I don't care about fashion.
I'm pregnant.
And I know you are too,so you gotta help me.
Then there's marketing.
I can't go in there.
I can't tell him.
It's gonna be okay.He has been incredibly supportive of me.
And if he gets a little upset,that's what the meatball sub is for.
Thank you.Okay.
Hey!
It's my fashion girls.
What's wrong?Why don't you sit down.
Dina has somethingthat she wants to tell you.
What's going on?Is it Mom?
Is she sick?
Is it Dad's heart?
Is that a sandwich?
Mom and Dad are fine.Is that a sandwich?!
Joey, there's somethingthat you should know.
Dina?
I'm pregnant.What?
Now.
Give him the sandwich!
Obviously, this is a mistake.You can't be pregnant.
Because you have to have sexto get pregnant.
Joe, I tried to wait untilI was 25, like you did.
What?
Dina..
I can't believe this.
You're the good one.You went to college!
Both years!
Who did this to you?
Bobby Corso.
But he's a real nice guy.I like him a lot.
He's real funny.
You got pregnant for "funny"?Dina, if he's funny, laugh!
I'll be back.
Stay here!Why?
Where you going?
I can't look at you right now.
I knew you wouldn't be supportive.So, what are you gonna do?
I would love to have kids... ...hear me play the songs that I will write for them.
What do we do for dinner?
We could cook for ourselves.
It's Erika.
My God.
The stalker!
Never mind.
It's open.
Hitting her with a frying pan is a good idea.
But we want a backup plan, just in case she isn't a cartoon!
Let's get out of here!
The one time they're not home!
We'll leave.
When we pass her... ...she won't know me, because we never met!
That's how radio stars escape stalkers!
She's coming!
It's me.
This is it.
This is how we're gonna die.
You ready?
Wait, wait, wait!
Only you who can save her, Drake!
Damn it!
I'm a doctor.
I'm not God!
There goes my whole belief system.
It's Erika.
Quick!
Shut off the TV.
I wanna see what happens!
I get Leslie out of the coma then we make out.
How can that be?
You were kissing Sabrina!
Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neurosurgeon.
Hey, Erika.
Come in.
How did you get here so fast?
I just saw you in Salem.
Right, they choppered me in.
What's up?
You're having a little party too!
Is she here?
Who?
Sabrina.
I know about you two!
I saw you today, kissing in the doctor's lounge.
It's not what you think You told me I was the only one!
All right, look.
That's it.
We shouldn't see each other anymore.
I should have told you a long time ago... ...but I am not Drake Ramoray.
I'm not even a doctor.
I'm an actor.
I just pretend to be a doctor.
Oh, my God!
Do the people at the hospital know?
Somebody wanna help me out here?
Oh, I know!
I know!
Where am I?
University Hospital... ...where you've been for the last 18 years.
How can you be here and there?
Because it's a TV show!
What are you getting at?
Nice girl, not great with concept.
I'm not Drake!
That's right!
He's not Drake.
He's... ...Hans Ramoray, Drake's evil twin!
Is this true?
Yes!
Yes, it is true!
And I know this... ...because he pretended to be Drake to sleep with me!
And then he told me he would run away with me!
And he didn't!
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard!
Is all this true?
Yes, I'm afraid it is.
You deserve much better than me.
You deserve to be with the real Drake.
He's the one you fell in love with.
Go to Salem.
Find him!
He's the guy for you!
Oh, Hans!
Hans?
Hans!
Yo, evil twin!
Right.
Goodbye, Erika.
Good luck in Salem.
Take care.
I'll never forget you, Hans.
All right.
The people who threw the water!
Helping you out!
It was my grandmother's.
Be careful.
If that falls off the truck,  it wouldn't be the worst thing.
Wow.
/  I know.
It seems smaller somehow.
Has it always been purple?
Look around, you guys.
This was your first home.
And it was a happy place,  filled with love and laughter..
But more important, because of  rent control, it was a friggin' steal!
Hey, do you realise that at one  time or another we all lived  in this apartment?
Oh, yeah, that's true.
Uh, I haven't.
Wait a minute.
What about that  summer during college that  you lived with grandma,   and you tried to make it as a dancer?
Do you realise we almost made  it ten years without that coming up?
Oh, honey, I forgot.
I promised Treeger  that we'd leave our keys.
Oh, okay.
So, I guess this is it.
Yeah.
I guess so.
This is harder than I thought it would be.
Oh, it's gonna be okay.
Do you guys have to go to the  new house right away, or do you  have some time?
We got some time.
Okay, should we get some coffee?
Sure.
Where
All right.
Hey, man, you feeling better?
We have something to tell you.
Oh, my God!
You're pregnant!
No!
Look, Joe, here's the thing.
Monica and I have decided to live together, here.
I'm gonna be moving out, man.
I'm really happy for you guys.
Congratulations.
See you later.
Are you okay?
I gotta go.
I've got an acting job.
Like you'd believe that.
This sucks!
I'll be across the hall.
And I promise you... the minute Monica and I break up, I'm moving right back in.
Maybe that's now.
If you're gonna move in with him...
I feel it is my responsibility to tell you the truth about him.
He's a terrible roommate.
Terrible.
He forgets to...
He always, he always... Who am I kidding?
He's the best roommate!
Really?
Yeah, I'm reading Ross Geller Magazine.
Have you seen Rachel?
No, why?
I have some exciting news.
You're pregnant.
No!
Chandler and I are moving in together.
Oh, that's good!
But if you were pregnant, what would you name it?
Hint, Phoebe.
What's up?
Chandler and I are moving in together.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my little sister and my best friend... shacking up.
That's great.
That's great.
Guys, I'm happy too.
Okay, come here.
Big day, huh?
People moving in.
People getting annulled.
I gotta go find Rachel.
Thought you were Rachel.
What gave me away?
I gotta tell her.
I told Ross and Phoebe.
She's the only one left.
It's official.
We're moving in together.
No turning back.
Are you scared?
Are you?!
No.
That was my scariest voice.
You're brave.
The worst day.
You're finally making progress at work, then your boss calls you Racquel.
Listen, for the first four years of my work, everybody called me...
Seriously.
I believe you.
It was in the middle of a meeting, so no one wants to correct her.
So everyone's calling me Racquel.
By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky.
Well, I still think you're very, very nice and very pretty.
What?
All yours, babe.
Have a seat.
Listen, Chandler and I... are going to live together.
Here.
Oh, my God.
That's so great!
I'm so happy for you guys!
Really?
And that was so sweet of you to ask.
The three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
Yes, we are.
Chandler, you'll have to watch those long showers you take... because you know Racquel can't be late.
He'll work on that.
This is so exciting!
Come and knock on our door We'll be waiting for you See?
You like me?
Okay.
Let's not make a big thing about this.
It's a huge thing!
Okay, not working with me, Joe.
Look, here's the thing.
Lately, I have been having thoughts.
Musings, if you will.
Well, for how long?
Oh, only like a month.
A month?
Well..
Dial it down.
Listen, maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do.
I have been thinking about, you know, us.
Okay, dial it up a little.
Oh, you're right.
Okay.
I just have a question.
Shoot.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm not trying to do anything.
It's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know?
And I mean, aren't you just a little curious what it would be like?
Am I curious?
I mean, I'm as curious as..   George!
Who?
Curious George!
You know, the monkey and the guy with the yellow hat.
Of course.
I remember.
He had a paper route.
Yeah, he did.
See, this is what I'm talking about.
No, I know.
We're great!
But, Rach, no, this can't happen.
Can't it just happen a little bit?
No!
It can't happen at all!
Why not?
Because, look, no one wants this to happen more than me, okay?
I have gone over this moment in my head 100 times..   and not once did I ever say no.
I couldn't do it to Ross.
But that wasn't gonna stop you before.
I know.
I know..   but I've thought about it a lot since then, and it just wouldn't be right.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
Oh, God, I shouldn't have said anything.
No, no.
No, no, no, no.
Hey, we'll be fine.
Like you said, it's no big deal.
It's not a big deal.
No big deal.
It's so not a big deal.
I'll see you later.
I'm sorry, we can't.
All right.
All right.
I mean, you just went out with my best friend, you know?
I just think it would be a really, really bad idea.
Or not.
I mean..   What
Welcome to Monica's!
May I take your coat?
Hi, Steve.
Hello, Monica.
Hello, greeter girl.
This is Rachel.
Yeah, okay.
Everything smells so delicious.
I can't remember a time I smelled such a delicious combination of.
Okay, smells.
It's a lovely apartment.
Thank you.
Would you like a tour?
I was just being polite, but all right.
What's up?
In the cab on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.
What?
Smoked a joint, you know?
Lit a bone.
Weed, hemp, ganja.
Okay, I'm with you, Cheech.
Is it dry in here?
Let me get you some wine.
I think we're ready for our first course too.
These are rock shrimp ravioli in a cilantro ponzu sauce with just a touch of minced ginger.
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy!
These are fantastic!
Oh, gosh!
I'm so glad you liked them.
Like them?
I couId eat 100 of them!
That's all there is of these but in about 8 1 /2 minutes, we'll serve some tartlets.
"Tartlets?"
"Tartlets. "
Word has lost all meaning.
Excuse me.
Can I help you with anything?
You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.
Oh, cool!
Taco shells!
These are.
They are like a little corn envelope, you know?
You don't want to spoil your appetite.
SugarO's!
You know, if you just wait another 6 1 /2 minutes.
Macaroni and cheese!
We gotta make this!
No, we don't.
Sorry.
Why don't you just have a seat here?
Give me the Gummy Bears.
Give them to me.
We'll share.
No.
Give me the bears.
You can't have any.
Give them to me!
This is not working.
Bears overboard!
They're drowning!
Hey, fellas!
Grab onto a SugarO!
Save yourselves!
Dinner is over!
What?
"What?"
Why?
"Why?"
I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this and you can't even wait 4 1/2 minutes for a tartlet?
How's this?
Sorry.
How about over here?
That just means it's working.
Does this hurt?
How about this?
There you go!
Oh, the throb
Rachel, you didn't find anyone, so you can't tell him.
You know what?
That doesn't matter.
Do you know how painful it is to tell someone you love them... ...and not have them say it back?
I don't care.
I can't watch.
What you reading?
Paper.
Yeah?
What's it about?
Events from around the globe.
There's something I have to talk to you about.
Everyone's saying I shouldn't.
But I think they're wrong.
People can be wrong.
Once at work...
...I thought carbon dating is fossilized I'm really trying to tell you something here.
Go ahead.
I think I'm just going to say it.
I'm just going to say it.
I'm still in love with you, Ross.
I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
What?
Was that a joke?
Because it's mean.
I'm so dead serious!
I'm totally serious!
Why are you laughing?
Because I just heard it!
I heard it.
And it's ridiculous!
I mean... You're married!
You're married, and it's just ridiculous!
When I said it, I sort of floated up out of my body.
And then I heard myself say it, and then the floating Rachel...
I was like, "You are such an idiot!"
Well, I am married.
I know.
Though I haven't spoken to her since the wedding.
I'm sorry.
That's not funny.
Actually, it kind of is.
My wife won't return my calls.
I don't know where my wife is.
"Hey, Ross!
Where's the missus?"
"Don't know!"
Oh, God!
You know what?
Could you forget I told you this?
Well, I kind of have to.
Because the thing is The thing is, you know, that you're married to Emily.
That is what the thing is.
Oh, God.
Things won't be weird between us, right?
Was that stupid?
Me telling you that?
I'm glad you did.
If nothing else... ...it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
That's what I said!
Thank you for being so nice.
No.
Thank you for...
Thank you.
You are asking the court for an annulment?
Yes, Your Honor.
Here are our forms, all filled out.
So based on your petition... you are seeking an annulment on the grounds... that "Mr. Geller is mentally unstable."
Fine.
I'm mentally unstable.
And based on the fact that "Mr. Geller is an intravenous drug user."
What?
Yes.
Heroin and crack.
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug.
Well, you would know.
Now, it also says here that you... "lied about your sexual preference before marriage."
Oh, come on.
Ross, please.
I found the magazines.
And finally, that you were "unable to consummate the marriage."
Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.
You know, I'm sorry, this is insane.
I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay and there is no problem... with my ability to consummate anything.
I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!
That won't be necessary.
And when we were dating, we consummated like bunnies.
If you were involved in a serious relationship, that creates a problem.
Rest assured, that relationship ended two years ago.
Strike "consummated like bunnies" from the record.
Oh, honey.
Thank God you're home.
I was getting worried.
I picked up the divorce papers.
I've already signed everything.
I put little X's where you need to sign.
Little X's.
Great!
That makes up for everything.
You know, you've done a lot of stupid stuff too, okay?
Name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one.
How about you flew to London to stop my wedding?
You told me you loved me after I was married.
Wait, that was different.
I did those things because I was in love with you.
Right.
You're right.
That's very different.
So let's just sign the papers.
What?
Nothing.
Okay, can we just sign, please?
Congratulations.
Okay, wait, Ross.
Wait a minute.
I kind of have a little confession.
What?
Well, you know, this whole marriage thing.
Kind of my idea.
Excuse me?
Remember how we were too drunk to remember anything when we were married?
I didn't really wanna say anything, but it just kept coming back to me.
We were in the casino and you thought it'd be funny to eat a lot of grapes.
And I thought it would be funnier if we got married.
So as a compromise we decided first to get married and then... to eat a lot of grapes.
Sorry I got us into this whole thing.
So then if you think about it... this is all your fault.
Yeah, don't push it, though.
I gotta say...
I know I divorce a lot of women.
Never thought I'd be divorcing you.
I know.
I always thought if we got married, that'd be the one that stuck.
And it wouldn't be a secret... and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.
Did I even treat?
No, it was on the house.
It was a newlywed special.
That may be the most depressing thing I've heard.
I should get these to my lawyer's office.
Thanks for taking care of all this.
No problem.
I'm gonna need a copy of those.
Totally.
Hey Hey  So, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption.
There's a lot to go over, but I'll explain everything as we go through it.
IIs... Is that a picture?
Yeah.
It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week.
I thought you might want to see it.
Look, doctor!
Look, before we sign anything we really have to talk...    We're not who you think we are.
I don't understand.
The agency must have made some mistake.
My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.
What?
That's impossible.
I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
I'll go check your file.
Excuse me.
So who are you?
Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler.
We're from New York.
Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby.
So you lied to me before?
Well, we... "bore false witness"...  See?
I could be a reverend.
I can't believe this.
But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...
Giving you my baby?
You think I'd give you my child after this?
Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...
I don't want to look at your file!
This is over.
Erica.
Wait!
I've nothing to say to you.
You have every reason to be upset.
We did lie.
But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long.
And we don't know how long it's gonna be before we get another chance again.
Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?
Erica, please.
Just consider us.
Ask them to see our file.
Our last name's Bing.
My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.
Oh yeah.
I actually liked you guys.
But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong.
But you did like us.
And you should.
My wife's an incredible woman.
She's loving and devoted and caring.
And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right...
I love my wife more than anything in this world.
And I...
It kills me that I can't give her a baby...
I really want a kid.
And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad.
But my wife... she's already there.
She's a mother... without a baby...
Please?
You still want that baby?
God bless you Chandler Bing!
I just felt like hanging out and reading.
The water was so great.
We jumped off this pier and my suit came off.
Sorry I missed that.
Joey and Chandler sure are funny.
I brought back half the beach in my hair.
It was so much easier when I shaved my head.
You know, I gotta tell you...
...I just loved your look when you were bald.
Really?
I think about shaving it all off again sometimes.
Really?
Yeah.
You definitely should do that.
You know what?
I should do it!
Yeah!
You know what?
Thank you.
You are so cool.
I was having a little chat with Bonnie, and guess what?
She happened to bring up who was behind the whole headshaving idea.
And now, who was it?
That's right.
It was you!
That was her idea.
I just gave her a nudge.
She said you gave her the razor.
So anyone up for a midnight dip in the ocean?
No, I'm good.
No, thanks.
Okay, I'll see you in a bit.
Okay, have fun.
Come on, see?
She doesn't look that bad.
You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head!
What the hell were you thinking?
I don't know.
You don't know?
You balded my girlfriend!
All right.
Do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else?
You're the one who ended it!
Remember?
Because I was mad at you!
Not because I stopped loving you!
You still love me?
No.
You still love me.
Yeah, so?
You love me.
What does this mean?
I mean, do you want to get back together?
No!
Maybe!
I don't know.
I still can't forgive you for what you did.
I can't.
But sometimes when I'm with you, I just feel so... What?
I just feel...
I just...  What?
I feel... No!
I don't care!
I'm not playing oneonone strip poker with you for practice!
Hi there.
That's that weird voice again.
Okay.
Let me try it again.
You're gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!
Okay, okay.
Close the door!
Hi, I'm Dorf!
Your date for the evening.
Dorf on dating?
That's good stuff
I have been in the bathroom.
Stay clear of the salmon mousse.
Scotch neat.
That's Rachel's father's drink.
Mine too.
Isn't that neat?
Scotch neat.
Would you excuse me?
Ross, whose glasses are those?
Mine.
You wear bifocals?
I have a condition apparently... ...that I require... ...two different sets of focals.
Do you know my husband has glasses just like that?
Well, those are very popular frames.
Neil Sedaka wears them.
I hear you can get people out of here.
You didn't tell me your boyfriend smokes.
Yeah, like a chimney.
Big smoker.
Big, big smoker.
In fact, I'm gonna go into the hallway and fire up this bad boy.
Are you wearing my glasses?
Yes.
I was just warming up the earpieces for you.
Thank you.
Is that one of my cigarettes?
Yes, it is.
I was just moistening the tip.
She's taking the trash out, so I can get you out of here.
But it has to be now.
She'll be back any minute.
What about my friend?
Only the three of you.
Any more and she'll get suspicious.
Let me just get my coat.
There isn't time!
Just leave everything.
They'll take care of you next door.
Is it true they have beer?
Everything you've heard is true.
Could you guys please keep it down?
We're trying to start a Boggle tournament.
True, if these people find out a funny game, then will be no people left in our party.
And Gunther!
What are you doing here?
Welcome to the fo All right, I'm sorry.
But these people needed me.
They work hard all week.
It's Saturday night.
They deserve to have a little fun.
Go!
You know, my party is fun.
It's a little quieter, less obvious sort of fun.
But if people would just give it a chance, it's You want me to see a therapist?
Sweetheart, you have a problem.
You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father.
Okay, Mom, I'll make an appointment.
But right now, I gotta go.
I gotta go do a thing.
Did you know your mother spent $1200 on bonsai trees?
I felt like Gulliver.
Daddy, I really want to hear more about this... ...but I just have to do some stuff.
You work and you work and you work at a marriage... ...but all he cares about is his stupid boat.
You work and you work and you work on a boat.
He always ridiculed my pottery classes.
And you sand it and varnish it.
But when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.
One night of her yoga and Bridges of Madison County...
The scotch, the cigarettes...
The bonsais and the Chihuahua...
I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now but What the hell does she want with half a boat?
Okay, everybody, it's time for flan!
I wanted to see if your offer was still good.
Well, sure.
Come in.
Well, what happened to your girlfriend?
We kind of broke up this morning.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.
Ohio, thank you.
Before you go, can I ask you a question?
When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend... ...what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?
I'd say about a month.
Really?
I'd say three to four.
Halfhour.
Interesting.
When it's your assistant, I'd say never.
All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you?
Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo point.
A "moo" point?
Yeah.
It's like a cow's opinion.
It just doesn't matter.
It's "moo."
Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
Don't listen to Joey.
Okay, would you look at him?
He's obviously depressed.
He's away from his family.
What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Okay, that's what I'm going to do.
Fine, take their advice.
No one ever listens to me.
When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
Thanks for talking to me.
Come on, what are bosses for?
Hug it out.
All right, he likes you back.
Told you, you should go for it.
What?
Street noise drown any of that out?
No?
See you later.
Okay.
What did Joey say?
I like you back?
You know... Well, see...
He... Joey knows that I'm very insecure about my back.
And you were hugging me... ...so, obviously, you are not repulsed by it.
Yeah!
Wait, that doesn't make any sense.
No?
All right, here's the truth.
Joey said what he said... ...because I'm attracted to you.
Wow.
Yeah, I admit it.
I have a crush on you.
I know that's crazy because we work together... ...and nothing could ever happen.
The last thing I wanted to do was freak you out... ...or make you feel uncomfortable.
Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
Oh, my God.
Those guys are stealing my car.
What?
Right there.
That's my car!
Hey!
Okay, that's gonna take one minute.
Do you have anything else you want to get off your chest?
I can't believe this.
We still have time to talk, and they're not even in the car yet.
Look, there they go.
Okay, Phoebe.
What good are you?
Look, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
Okay.
I never should've said what I said.
It just doesn't matter how I feel.
We work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us.
I would love to go to work on Monday and never talk about this again.
Okay.
Big day, Monday.
Lots to do.
So we okay?
I'm not.
I knew it.
I freaked you out.
No, you didn't.
What freaked me out was you saying nothing could happen between us.
Really?
Yeah.
So please don't fire me for doing this.
That's one less thing we have to do on Monday.
I think Barry's seeing someone in the city.
What would make you think that?
Ever since we announced the engagement, he's acted weird.
And then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel!
Really?
If it'll make you feel any better when Barry and I got engaged, he went through a weird thing too.
Oh, God!
That's what I was afraid of.
What's what you were afraid of?
When Barry was engaged to you, he and I kind of had a little thing on the side.
What?
I know, I know.
When he proposed to me, everyone said, "Don't do it.
He'll do to you what he did to Rachel. "
And now I feel so stupid.
You are so stupid.
We are both so stupid.
What do you mean?
Smell familiar?
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Oh, no, me.
I am so sorry.
No, I am sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh, my!
You got a second?
Sure, sure.
Come on in.
Hello, sweetheart.
What you guys doing here?
We are here to break up with you.
Both of you?
We think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you.
I'm sorry.
God, I am so sorry!
I'm an idiot!
I was weak!
I couldn't help myself.
Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much.
Which one of us are you talking to there?
Mindy.
Of course, Mindy!
It was always Mindy.
Even when we were having sex in that chair?
I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.
Oh, please!
During that second time, you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
You did it twice?
The first time didn't count.
You know, it was Barry.
Oh, right.
Honey, baby, sweetheart, look.
Just give me another chance.
We'll start all over again.
We'll go back to Aruba.
What do you say?
Dr. Farber, we've got an emergency here.
Jason Castalano's choking on his retainer.
Oh, God!
I'll be right there, Bernice.
Look, please don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.
Okay, and we'll be here, hating you!
See how he was sweating when he walked out?
If I'm hogging the ball too much, you jump right in there and take a couple of punches.
This feels great!
I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
What are you talking about?
Mindy, the guy is the devil!
He is Satan in a smock!
Look, I know he's not perfect.
But the truth is at the end of the day I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber D.D.S.
Oh, God!
I hope you can find some way to be happy for me.
And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor.
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
You okay?
Really?
Ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding I have wondered whether I made the right choice.
And now I know.
I'm so glad.
Big day.
That sounds good.
I'm not having an affair.
Nancy... is our realtor.
I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!I knew it.
Why... wwhy do you have a realtor?
Um... she's been showing us houses outside of the city.
What?
Are you serious?
When we found out that we were going to get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decidedthat we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
So you're, so you're gonna move?
Oh, my god.
Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city?
I'm doing it.
Ross is doing it.
Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it.
And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swing set.
And a street where our kids can ride their bikesand maybe an ice cream truck can go by.
So you want to buy a house in the '50s.
Have you thought about what you're giving up?
You can't move out of the city.
What if... what if you want chinese food at 5:00 A.M.?
Or a fake rolex that breaks as soon as it rains?
Or an asian hooker sent right to your door?
You know what?If you want to look for a house, that's okay.
No, no, it's not.Don't listen to him.I'm gonna thump you.
It's okay because they have to get it out of their system.
Okay?
But, you're gonna realize,this is the only place you want to be.
Actually... we already found a house we love.
What?
And about an hour ago, we made an offer.
Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?
You put an offer on a house?
It has this big yard that leads down to this stream.
And then there's these old maple trees.
Oh, again with the nature!What are you, beavers?
Look, I know this is really hard, and we're really sorry.
Is this because I come over herewithout knocking and eat your food?Because I can stop doing that.
I...
I really, really think I can.
You know that's not the reason, Joe.
I think if you saw it, you'd understand.
I mean, you guys were there.It'sit's beautiful, isn't it?
Yeah, it is.
What the hell are you doing?!Well...
it is, all right?
When we were out there today,all I keep thinking was,I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but man, this would be a nice place to live!
Yeah, but so is this.
You can't move.You just... you just can't.
Rachel's right.This is where you guys belong.
Yeah, you don't want to live in westchester.
That's like the worst of the chesters.
You know, sometimes,when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here, You guys are just having dinner or watching TV or something,but...
It makes me feel better.
And now when I look over, who am I gonna see?The gottliebs?
The yangs?
They don't make me feel so good.
Yeah, soso don't move, okay?
Just stay here, and... Maybe close your blinds at night.
Hello?
Well, it's a good thing we got it, then.
What?
!We got the house!
Oh, my god!
I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
Oh, my god!
We got it?We got the house?!
We are getting the house.
We are getting a house and a baby, We are growing up.
We sure are.
So who is gonna tell them?
Not it!
/ Not it!Damn it!
And rachel, this is yours.
What are these for?!
You'll see.
All right.
Everybody, open them.
oh, wow, this is so beautiful!
Oh, these are the ones I was looking at in the store.I know.
I love this.
A meatball sub!?
Thanks!
Seriously, you guys.
What's going on?What are these for?
Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... we got the house.Enjoy!
What did they say
We're checking out of the bridal suite.That's right, I'm no longer a bride.
I'll never be a bride again.Now I'm just someone's wife.
And I'm the happiest guy in the world.
Honey, don't be upset.
We still haveso much to look forward to.
Yeah, right.
We got the honeymoon.That's not till Thursday.
The wedding pictures.It won't be ready for weeks.
Not the disposable camerasfrom the tables.
That's true.I knew I married you for a reason!
Tell you what, I will go get themdeveloped, and you can go home.
What?
What did you take a picture of?Nothing.
It was something.
Ross has the cameras.Has he checked out yet?
Are you joking?Checkout is not till noon.
And he has a good 11 minutes left.So?
So Ross had never checked out of a rooma minute before he had to.
One time, when we were dating,we got a late checkout.
He got so excited,it was the best sex we ever had.
Until he screamed out "Radisson"at the end.
Okay, well, I'm gonna get Ross,get the cameras and get them developed.
32, Joe.
You're 32!
Here's a copy of your bill.Thanks.
Champagne, strawberries..   Oh, my God!
I can't believe Chandlerordered porn on our wedding night.
Yeah, that's sad.Mashuga Nut?
Excuse me, could you take a picture of us?Of course.
Would you take one of us?
Yeah, sure.
Click.
It didn't click.I heard it.
But there was no flash.Why won't you take our picture?
Oh, yeah.
I'll take your picture.
Your finger was covering the lens.
Who are you, Ansel Adams?Get out of here!
Look, I feel really bad abouthow I freaked you out before..   so I asked the father to meet you hereso you could tell him.
Why don't you go up onstage.I'll get a picture of you doing the speech.
Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabreplease see the front desk?
Your car is about to be towed.
That's my car!
A '95 LeSabre?Yes.
A green LeSabre?Yes!
I'm sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre.Yes, greenblue.
Well, go.
Go move it!
Ready for the last picture?Get ready to run.
Congratulations on your wedding.
We're hanging in the kitchen.Let's stay in the kitchen.
It's picture time.You're gonna love these.
Here's a picture of Ross.
And that's me.
And that's me and Ross.
And here's a picture of our first kissas a married couple.
Wow, that is a great picture.
Yeah!
And interesting, because I foundthe cameras in one of our bags.
Didn't see that coming.
So this isn't a pictureof our first kiss..   but it is a pictureof my first kiss with this lady.
Which, by the look on your face, I'm sureyou'll remember, so there's no need..
I'll take the real pictures to get developed.Good idea.
You opened all the presents without me?We were gonna do that together.
You kissed another woman?!
Call it even?Okay.
Just hanging out.
What's this?
Ross' wedding invitation?
Maybe that's the one we should have hidden.
No, you guys, come on.
You don't have to do that.
I'm happy for him.
I am.
I really I'll work on it.
I'm sorry.
You're going to come, though, aren't you?
I don't know.
This isn't one of those "If she doesn't come, we don't come"?
I bought my ticket.
You're not even invited.
You know what would be real weird?
If you weren't there.
Just say you'll think about it.
I'll think about it.
Who's this from?
That's Ross'.
Oh, my God!
He remembered.
Remembered what?
It was months ago.
We were walking by this antique store.
I saw this and told him it was like one my grandmother had... ...when I was a little girl.
I can't believe he remembered!
This must've cost a fortune.
I can't believe he did this.
He broke up with Julie!
Go hug her, for God's sakes!
Really?
Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
That's okay.
You're worth the wait.
And I don't just mean tonight.
Oh, God!
Honey.
That's okay.
No, you just rolled over the juice box.
Did you say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the copy place?
You ended it!
Because I was mad at you.
Not because I stopped loving you.
You still love me?
What does this mean?
Do you want to get back together?
Maybe.
I don't know.
I just, I feel...
I can't believe I even thought of getting back together.
I can't believe you did that.
Yeah, well... See?
He's her lobster!
No.
You're really not going?
It's just going to be too hard.
You know, I mean... ...it's Ross.
How can I watch him get married?
It's just for the best.
You know?
It is.
Plus somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe.
She's going to be pretty big by then.
She'll need someone to help her tie her shoes.
Drive her to the hospital if she goes into labor.
You don't have a car.
And your license expired.
There's so much to do, and I have so little time!
Check this out.
You can't go to a museum in your underwear.
You could, but just the one time.
Does anyone else think David Copperfield's cute?
No.
But he told me he thinks you're a fox.
All right.
Janice likes him.
In fact, she likes him so much, she put him on her freebie list.
Her what?
We have a deal where we each get to pick five celebrities we could sleep with... ...and the other one can't get mad.
The heart of every healthy relationship: Honesty, respect and sex with celebrities.
So who's on your list?
Kim Basinger... ...Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry... ...Yasmine Bleeth... ...and Jessica Rabbit.
You do realize that she is a cartoon and way out of your league?
I know.
I always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
This is such a great thing.
Who would yours be?
First, I need a boyfriend.
Then I can have a list.
It's just a game, Mon.
Rach, how about you?
I don't know.
I guess Chris O'Donnell, John F. Kennedy Jr... ...Daniel DayLewis, Sting and Parker Stevenson.
SpiderMan?
Hardy Boy.
Peter Parker.
Thank you.
What about you, honey?
Who'd be on your list?
That kind of thing requires some serious thought.
First, I'd divide my prospective candidates into categories.
What a geek!
Everybody, this is Frank!
Celebrities I'm allowed to sleep with.
God, you're giving this a lot of thought.
Hey, it's hard, okay?
I only have two spots left.
All right.
Who you got it narrowed down to?
Elizabeth Hurley.
Very attractive.
Forgiving.
Susan Sarandon.
You know what?
She's too political.
She probably wouldn't let you do it unless you donated four cans of food first.
And Isabella Rossellini.
Very hot.
Very sexy.
But she's too international.
She's never gonna be around.
So?
So you gotta play the odds.
Pick somebody who's gonna be in the country all the time.
Yeah.
Because that's why you won't get Isabella Rossellini.
Geography.
Okay.
So by "melting" you meant melting.
Hi.
Bye.
Okay.
I'm done with my choices.
These are final.
Well, it's about time.
Yeah.
Very official.
Yeah.
Well, you know, Chandler printed it up on his computer.
And who laminated it?
That was me.
All right, let me see.
"Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurley... ...Michelle Pfeiffer... ...Dorothy Hamill"?
Hey, it's my list!
You do realize she only spins like that on ice?
What's going on?
I love this tushy!
Can I take it to work with me?
Yeah, sure.
It's not mine anyway.
It came with the pants.
I am so jealous.
You guys are just right there.
Yes.
Right where?
The beginning, where it's all sex and talking... ...and sex and talking.
You got to love the talking.
And the sex?
We haven't had sex.
What's the big deal?
This is special.
I want our love to grow before moving to the next level.
Oh, Chandler, that is so nice.
That is really nice... ...Iying!
No way is that the reason.
Why?
Because you're not mature enough to understand that?
He's right.
I'm totally lying.
Then what is it?
Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
And you're afraid you won't be able to fill his shoes?
I'm afraid I won't make love as well as him.
I was going for the metaphor.
I was saying the actual words.
He's had a lot of girlfriends.
Doesn't mean he's great in bed.
We share a wall.
Either he's great, or she liked to agree with him a lot.
It'll be different.
The sex will be great because you're in love.
Just go for it.
Yeah, you should.
All right.
I'll sleep with my girlfriend.
But I'm just doing it for you guys.
So did you do it?
Yes, yes, we had the sex.
It was bad?
It was fine, but she didn't agree with me as strongly as with Joey.
She was like, "I see your point.
I'm all right with it."
There's not always a lot of agreement the first time.
Yeah.
Not for girls, anyway.
Guys agree like that.
Look, you have to help me.
I mean...
I know what to do with a woman.
It's always nice.
I need to know... ...what makes it go from nice to: "My God!
Somebody's killing her in there!"
I'll show you something a lot of guys don't know.
All right.
Now.
You don't have to draw an actual Whoa, she's hot!
Everyone knows the erogenous zones.
You got one, two, three... ...four... ...five, six and seven.
There are seven?
Let me see that.
Oh, yeah.
That's one?
Kind of an important one.
I was looking at it upside down.
Well, you know, sometimes that helps.
Most guys will hit one, two, three and then go to seven and set up camp.
That's bad?
At Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Matterhorn.
You might if it were like seven.
All right, the important thing is to take your time.
You want to hit them all... ...mix them up.
Keep them on their toes.
Oh, toes!
For some people.
All right.
You could start out with a little one.
A two.
A one, two, three.
A three.
A five.
A four.
A three, two.
Two.
A two, four, six.
Two, four, six.
Four.
Two.
Two.
Four, seven!
Five, seven!
Six, seven!
Seven!
Seven!
Seven!
These little women!
You're liking it?
Oh, yeah.
Amy just burned Jo's manuscript.
I don't see how he could forgive her.
Jo's a girl.
It's short for Josephine.
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie.
You mean it's like a girlgirl thing?
Because that is the one thing missing from The Shining.
No, actually, Laurie's a boy.
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
Hey.
Hey.
How'd the basketball go?
I learned how to shoot a layup, a foul shot, and a 23pointer.
You mean a 3pointer?
I get more because I'm dainty.
So is there a phone here I check my messages?
Yeah, in the back.
Do you want a quarter?
No, thanks.
I always carry one in my sock.
What are you doing?
Get back over on your side of the... Hello!
Hi, I'm Joey.
We haven't met.
Good to meet you.
Robert.
What?
What?
You guys, what is going on?
Do you not like Robert?
Why are you laughing?
Calm down.
There's no reason to get testy.
You guys!
Come on!
We're sorry.
We're sorry.
It just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area... ...as one may have hoped.
What do you mean?
Hey.
Hey.
Robert, could you pass me those cookies?
Sure.
Stretchy pants?
Those are the greatest things in the world!
If I were you, I'd wear them every day, every day!
Jeez, thank you.
Really, that's so nice.
But, to be honest, I don't think I can wear these.
They're so tight.
I'd feel like I'm on display.
I'm sorry.
That's all right.
I'll figure... Hey.
How's it going?
Good.
Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?
Danny just went into room 217.
The next part's the best!
When that dead lady in the bathtub... No!
Come on, you're gonna ruin it!
All right, I'll talk in code.
Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
Yeah, that's very cool.
All blank and no blank makes blank a blankblank.
No, the end!
When Jack almost kills them all with that blank... ...but in the last second they get away.
Joey, I can't believe you just did that.
I can't believe she cracked your code.
All right.
Okay.
Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no... ...even though she's still in love with him.
And then he ends up marrying Amy.
Hey, mine was by accident!
All right.
The boiler explodes and destroys the hotel and kills the dad.
Beth dies.
Beth... Beth dies?
Is that true?
If I keep reading, is Beth gonna die?
No, Beth doesn't die.
She doesn't die.
Does she, Rachel?
What?
Joey's asking if you've ruined... ...the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson.
No.
She doesn't die.
Then why would you say that?
Because I wanted to hurt you.
There they are.
I dropped my keys.
Got them.
Okay, Rachel, are you comfortable?If I said I was, would you judge me?
The doctor'll be here in a minuteto do your sonogram.
Okay.
Oh, man, I swear, if they sold theseat Pottery Barn..   Hi.Hi.
We need to talk.
Right now?
Because I kind of gotan alfresco situation going on over here.
Please, I really..
I want to apologizefor the way I acted earlier today.
That's fine.
Can you stay up near my head?What?
Oh, yeah, sorry.
I went crazy.
I was thinking about myselfwhen I should've been thinking about you..
Okay, head, Ross!
Head, Ross!Right.
I want you to know that I'm gonna be therethrough this whole thing.
Okay?
The doctor's appointments, the Lamazeclasses, babyproofing the apartment.
Although, we can worry about thatafter we get married.
Married?Well, yeah, I think we should get married.
Because that's your answer to everything?
No.
Because that's the right thing to do.
Yeah, maybe, if you're in love.But Ross, we are not in love, are we?
No.
But still, I mean,you can't possibly do this alone.
Excuse me?
You can't even eat alone in a restaurant.What?
If you can't eat by yourself, how do youexpect to have a baby by yourself?
I can too eat by myself!When have you ever?
When certain people leave the tableand I am not finished!
Well, certain other people take two hoursto eat a bowl of soup!
Oh, please.
You inhale your food.
I grew up with Monica.If you didn't eat fast, you didn't eat!
Am I interrupting?
No, Dr. Long.
Please come in.This is Ross.
He is the father.
But not the husband, because,evidently, she can do this alone.
Nice to meet you.
I'll get started on this.
Why you can't admit you need me?I need you to stay near my head!
Okay.
Everything looks good.Here it is on the screen.
Here's your uterus..   and right here is your baby.
Oh, my God.
There it is.
I see it.
Congratulations.I'll give you two a minute.
Okay.Thank you.
Pretty amazing, huh?
I don't see it!
What?I can't see it.
I didn't want herto think I was a terrible mother.
I can't even see my own baby!
Oh, sure.
Come here.
Sure, you can.Come here.
Look, it's right there.
Oh, it's beautiful.
I see it now.
Do you really?No, I don't see it!
Okay.
Come on.
All right.
Okay.
You see this tiny thingthat looks like a peanut?
Yeah.
Sweetie, that's it.
That's it?
Well, I saw that.
Thank you.You're welcome.
Wow, I can't believe that's our baby.
Yeah, that's our baby.
So how was the doctor?Everything went great.
Good.Hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
I don't see the baby.
Where is it?
Oh, no, I know.
I couldn't see it eitherat first.
But it's right..   Ross, I lost it again
They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
That paper is two weeks old.
Who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?
I really wanted to take Kathy to this.
At least you have somebody to miss stuff with.
I hate being alone this time of year.
Next it's Valentine's Day... ...then my birthday, then bang!
Before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again.
I want somebody!
You know, I want a man!
It doesn't even have to be a big relationship.
Just a fling!
I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
Let me tell you, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.
There are nice guys in my office.
Want me to set you up?
I've been single a long time.
Why haven't you offered before?
I'm happy.
I no longer go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
Okay.
No accountants.
And no one from "legal."
I don't like boring jobs.
And Ross was what?
A lion tamer?
I say, Drew?
Are you seeing anybody right now?
I'm not asking for me.
I'm not gay.
I'm not asking you out.
I'm not gay.
I didn't think you were gay.
I do now.
My friend, Rachel, wants to be set up.
I just got out of a big relationship.
I'm not looking to get serious.
That's okay.
A fling might be all right with her.
Is this "Hot Rachel" that you took to the Christmas Party?
By the way, that is her full name.
Wow!
I'm free for her.
Wait, I didn't say I wasn't free.
Let's talk it over at the Ranger game.
Hold on.
I just got a box of Cubans.
I'll bring them by your office at five.
That's a little later than I usually stay, but sure.
Before the game, we could enjoy some eightyearold Basil Haydens.
I don't know what that is, but that's a pretty nice jacket.
I'm writing a holiday song for everyone.
Do you want to hear it?
Happy Hanukkah, Monica May your Christmas be snowy, Joey Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross Spin the dreidel, Rachel Pheebs, that's great!
Happy Hanukkah, Monica May your Christmas be snowy, Joey Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross Spin the dreidel, Rachel Pheebs, that's great!
But you know, Rachel doesn't rhyme with dreidel.
I know, but it's so hard.
Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
What are you talking about?
Lots of things rhyme with Rachel: Bagel, mail, jail, bail, cable.
Maypole.
All good.
Thanks.
Do you, maybe, have a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
Didn't your dad used to call you "Pumpkin"?
Pumpkin?
But did he ever call you "Budolph"?
Hello, children.
Have I got the 50 guys for you!
Really?
I showed them your picture.
Guys are throwing themselves at me and giving me stuff.
Knicks tonight?
Where are the seats?
Wherever!
I've got 20.
Will I like any of these guys?
You know, I'm going to... ...play the field a little bit more.
Guys are signing over their 401 Ks to me.
You work with robots?
Yes.
One guy, Patrick, you'll like him.
He's nice, funny and a swimmer.
I like swimmers' bodies.
His dad made the magnetic strip on credit cards.
I like credit cards!
I'm not bad at this!
What does he do?
He works in fine foods.
You have a fine foods division?
It's a big company... Now, wait a second.
You make food and robots?
No, the robots just work for them.
Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?
She didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row.
I'm so sorry.
Why doesn't she want to hang out with us?
Because she thinks that you are blah.
And that you, Monica, are too loud.
What?!
What?
So she just pretended to have a good time?
She was lying to our faces?
I can't believe this.
Who is she to judge us?
We couldn't have been nicer to her.
And I am not blah.
I am a hoot!
Come on, please, you guys.
Don't be mad.
I'm sure she said it... because she was nervous because you're my best friends.
And it was our first date.
Plus, she's really sick.
You said you made that up!
But isn't the sick thing better than the play thing?
They're both good.
I generally just go with, "Monica's drunk again."
Come on, please just give her another chance.
She'll come around, I promise.
Of course we will.
Come on, we gotta make dinner.
Okay.
I do not like that woman!
I can hear you!
I am loud!
Can you please not put your feet up on my new..?
Well, good.
See?
Wasn't that fun?
We have got to move.
What?
I knew it!
You're not so quiet yourself, missy!
I'm blah?
The only thing more boring than modern dance... is you talking about it.
"Oh, Chandler, I just lost myself in the movement."
You know, I know you're talking... but all I hear is, "Blahblahblahblahblah."
All right, you and me!
You two, go home.
I gotta talk to Janine.
I really think you could take her.
You better hope I don't see you in the hallway!
All right.
Look, we got a little bit of a problem here.
You can't my treat my friends that way.
They said stuff to me too.
I know, I'll talk to them about it.
They mean so much to me.
They're like my family, you know?
If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time...
I don't think we can be together.
It just can't work, okay?
It can't.
I'm very upset.
Okay.
Would it help if I apologized?
Yeah.
That'd be very helpful.
What did I tell you about the hall?
I was coming over to apologize for my behavior.
I'd really like it if we could be friends.
Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so...
I would like that too.
Great.
Now, come on.
I'm glad we worked it out.
Me too.
I'll see you.
Bye.
Or I'll hear you.
That's it, big girl!
Wait!
You'd better run!
Did you hear that?
What am I gonna do?
I'm sorry, man.
Want to go watch?
Yeah!
Are you kidding me?
I know what to do with tall girls.
You go for their knees.
How you doing?
So did she move out?
Pretty much.
I can't believe you just broke up with her.
When it's not right, you know it.
You okay?
I'll be all right.
You know what would cheer you up?
What?
I'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night.
I think you should come.
You're right, that did cheer me up
Hey, Chandler.
Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
Neat.
I'm gonna die alone!
Okay, you win.
Chandler, you are not gonna die alone.
Janice was my safety net, okay?
And now I have to get a snake.
Why is that?
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing.
You know, a hook.
Like that guy on the subway who eats his own face.
So I figure I'll be "Crazy Man With A Snake."
Crazy Snake Man.
Then I'll get more snakes, call them my babies.
Kids will run past my place!
"Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
You've got to get over this.
You won't end up alone.
Of course I will.
I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me... ...and then I bitch that there aren't any great women out there.
You have just described... ...virtually every man that we've ever gone out with.
You are not a freak.
You're a guy.
She's right.
You're no different than the rest.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Yes, he is.
You are totally different.
In a bad way?
No, honey, in a wonderful way.
You know what you want now.
Most guys don't even have a clue.
You're ready to take risks, be vulnerable and intimate with someone.
You're not gonna end up alone.
You called Janice.
That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
You've made it!
You're there!
You are ready to make a commitment!
Don't know about that!
What you got there?
Something else that's not yours that you can break?
I know you like this and I want you to have it.
It'll look good in our apartment.
Thank you.
That's fine.
You'll all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night.
This woman Allison from work.
She is great.
She's pretty, she's smart.
And I've been... ...holding off asking her out in the past, because she has a... ...unusually large head.
But I'm not going to let that stuff hang me up anymore.
Look at me.
I'm growing.
You can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
I'll take that.
You want his yearbook?
Some people said nice things about him.
Somebody should have it.
Gosh, this is so weird.
His whole life was in this apartment and now it's gone.
I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments for Mr. Heckles.
He was kind of a pain.
He was, but he was a person.
You're all going to hell.
It's really not that big!
Taking that with you, huh?
Oh, yeah.
You coming?
In a second.
Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.
We'll try to keep it down.
My major was useless.
How often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher Wanted"?
Sure.
My God, that's a big head!
It didn't look this big in the office.
Maybe it's the lighting.
My head must look like a golf ball at work.
Don't get hung up on it.
Quick!
List five things you like about her.
Nice smile, good dresser.
Big head, big head, big head
Neither did I!
Hey, great skirts!
Birthday present?
From who?
From you!
I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Well, it's the thought.
Doesn't Ross' flight get in in a couple hours?
At gate 27B?
I've been thinking about it.
I've decided this Ross thing is not a good idea.
Why?
Because I feel Like I wouldn't just be going out with him.
I would be going out with all of you.
There'd be all this pressure and.
No pressure, no pressure!
Nothing has even happened yet and you're already so.
I'm not "so. "
I was a teensy bit weird at first but I'II be good.
I promise.
Who is it?
It's me, Carl.
Come on up.
Behind my brother's back?
Is the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
Seven hundred bucks!
AII right, you did it!
I'm just saying, if I see one more picture of Ed Begley Jr in that stupid electric car I'II shoot myself!
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not against environmental issues, per se it's just that guy!
I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Excuse me, please.
I'm trying to have a date here.
Fine, just stop thinking about me.
Can't do it, can you?
So I'm thinking about you.
So what?
I don't get it.
What do you see in this guy anyway?
Well, he seems to be a very nice guy.
I mean, come on, buddy!
Get a real car!
Rachel, come on.
Give us a chance.
It's too hard.
Because it'll get weird for everyone else?
Who cares?
This is about us.
I've been in Love with you since the ninth grade.
You're, Like, my best friend.
I know.
If we broke up, and I lost you.
Why do you think we'll break up?
Have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
No.
But it only has to happen once.
You and I know we are perfect for each other.
Right?
So the only question is: Are you attracted to me?
I don't know.
I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
Well start Looking!
Exactly!
And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!
Right!
You're right!
You know what?
I forgot, I need to pick up a friend at the airport.
I am so sorry!
If you want to stay and finish your drinks, please do.
I'm sorry, I gotta go.
I'm sorry!
But.
Excuse me!
Pardon me!
I'm sorry.
Toby for God's sake, will you Let it go?
There's no Rachel!
I got that!
Thanks, sweetie.
No problem.
I cannot wait for you to meet my friends!
Really?
You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
No, they will.
I just.
Can't wait!
Can't wait!
Come on, they're gonna Love you
I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present... ...for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
Any luck?
Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible Things for Kathy."
Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
Just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen... ...and you get her something worse than that... ...like a regular pen.
She's really going to love this, you know?
The bottom line is, I want her to have it... ...even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
Honey, that's so sweet.
You don't think it's just pathetic?
Oh, "pathetic"!
I've been looking all over for you.
Where?
Our place.
The hall.
I got something for her.
It's a book.
A book?
Is it a book that's also a safe?
It was her favorite as a kid.
So just let me know if she likes it, okay?
You got it.
Thanks for doing this.
I owe you one.
There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
No, it came out to an even twenty.
Wow.
That's almost as much as a new book.
It'll be like I have a wife in the 50s!
How did she like the gift?
She loved it.
She's showing the girls right now.
Yeah?
That's great.
I got to tell you...
...I feel bad taking credit for this, because... ...am I going to get a lot of credit for this!
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
You know, Chandler got you a gift too.
No, he didn't.
Yeah, he did.
Look, it's right there on the counter.
Happy birthday.
I'm sorry.
You really didn't have to.
You think it's just a pen, but you turn it over and it's also a clock.
No, this is great!
Thank you, Chandler.
Oh, yeah.
Want to go to bed?
I'll be in, in a minute.
Don't forget your coupon.
Good night.
Thank you for the gift.
I just knew that sometimes when you're writing... ...you don't always know the exact time.
No, I didn't mean the pen.
Thank you for the book.
The book?
The Velveteen Rabbit?
I have a feeling you had something to do with it.
What do you mean?
When Joey gave it to me he said: "This is because I know you like rabbits, and I know you like cheese."
Thanks.
I love it.
I know how hard it must have been for you to find.
In case you missed that, that sound was, "Oh, well."
You must really like Joey to go to all that trouble.
Oh, yeah.
He's my He's my best friend.
Well... Good night.
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.
So would it be okay if I cleaned it?
Oh, yeah, he's too cute to be straight.
Knockers will help us figure it out.
All right, straight.
And not subtle.
He left his cell phone.
We could hand it to Gunther to put it in lost and found.
Or we could use it to call China, see how those guys are doing.
What if he calls his own cell phone and I answer... ...and we start talking and we fell in love?
Wouldn't that be a great story?
Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
That does sound great.
I'm gonna get the phone.
What?
Wait.
Why do you get the story?
I haven't been out on a date in so long.
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
That wasn't a date.
That was friends getting together and having sex.
Okay.
Great.
I get the phone.
No way.
You just broke up with Tag a week ago.
Yeah, and until now, I didn't think I would love again.
Nice try.
Wait.
How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
I don't know.
Maybe we could... Aha!
You stole the phone.
No, I didn't.
You're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?
No.
Okay.
But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.
Oh, it does work.
Phoebe.
That is a different phone.
Oh, is it?
Hello.
Yes, hi, is Rachel there?
Yes, she is.
Just one moment, please.
It's for me!
That is damning evidence.
Oh, my God.
I bet that's him.
My digital fairy tale's about to begin.
I wonder how it should be?
Should I be, "Hello"?
Or should I be, "Hi!
It's Ra..."?
Would you stop doing that?
Hello?
Yes, I'm the one who found your phone.
Phoebe, you can't...
I'm on a call.
Yeah, you can pick it up tonight.
Say, 8:30?
At my apartment.
It's 5 Morton Street, apartment 14.
And then maybe, you know, after, we can grab a bite to eat or whatever.
Okay.
Okay, I'll see you then.
Bye.
You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
How will you know what time to come over?
You just said it.
They should be right... Hey, hey!
Who is it?
It's Tom.
I'm here to pick up the phone.
Why do you get to answer the door?
Why shouldn't I?
Because it's my apartment.
Then I get to give him the cell phone.
Okay.
Good luck explaining all the calls to China.
Hi.
Wow, how long were we arguing for?
You're not the man who left the phone.
No, that's my assistant.
Is he coming?
No.
Could you give us one second?
Sure.
We'll be right back, sir.
What do we do?
I don't know.
Can you believe this?
We were waiting for a hot guy, and then an even hotter one shows up.
I know.
What?
No, they do, but you just have to wait.
Rachel, listen... ...if you let me have him, then I will really owe you one.
All right.
All right, I will let you have him.
But you owe me.
You owe me big.
Yeah.
You're such a great friend.
Which one of you lovely ladies am I taking to dinner?
Oh, that'd be me, sir.
After you.
Okay, byebye.
Did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
Yeah, look what I got!
See, she's fully dressed, right?
And then you click it, and she's naked!
And then you click it again, and she's dressed.
She's a business woman, walking down the street.
She's window shopping, and she's naked!
Hi.
Hello.
You know what?
I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
I'm sorry.
I was an idiot.
A big idiot.
It's just you have to realize this whole Mark thing is really hard for me.
Honey, why is it hard?
We've been together for almost a year now.
Well, I was with Carol for, like, eight years.
And I lost her.
And now, if it's possible, I think I love you even more.
So it's hard for me to believe I'm not gonna... ...well, that someone else isn't gonna take you away.
Let it be me.
Let it be me!
Honey, that's very sweet.
It just seems to me, though, that if two people love each other... ...and trust each other, like we do... ...there's no reason to be jealous.
I gotta get going.
Bye, Chandler.
Okay, Ross, this pen's getting kind of boring.
Can you pick me up some porn?
Where you going?
I've gotta go pick up Ben.
We got a playdate this afternoon.
With who?
Just this woman I met last night at the party.
There was a woman at...?
The stripper?
Yeah.
You have a playdate with a stripper?
Man, I gotta get a kid!
Yeah, we started talking after she did her thing... ...and it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age.
So we're gonna take the kids to a Gymboree class.
Is that okay?
Sure.
Is she married?
No.
Are you jealous?
No, I just don't see why she has to play with you.
That's all.
I mean, doesn't she, you know, have any other strippermom friends of her own?
You are totally jealous!
I'm not jealous, all right.
This is about... ...people feeling certain things... ...you know, about... ...strippers.
And, you know...
I love you too.
Bye.
Wait, wait, wait!
What?
Well, there's a kiss he won't forget for a few hours.
Either that or you just turned him on and sent him to a stripper.

Incredible!
I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
Who?
All right.
I'll give you one hint.
Warren Beatty.
Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind of a problem.
See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.
'Cause he was just so darn cute.
No, as part of the audition.
See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.
Well, hey.
You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it.
Or you just do it.
I did do it, I'm a professional.
Besides my first girlfriend was Lisa Dibertis, so I am no stranger to the mustache.
See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'.
Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.
Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks.
What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.
The one with Barry And Mindy's Wedding Hey, what did your agent say?
Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday.
Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong.
Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.
What, forget it!
Yeah, right.
Come on, I need your help here.
All right.
I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.
You see this, this is a friend.
Uhhuh, let's go.
Oh, wait I have gum.
Okay.
Good, very good, firm but tender.
I'd recommend you to a friend.
Then I don't know what it is.
What's the problem?
Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Over my dead body!
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
Come on out, honey!
I'm telling you look good!
Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.
Oh my God, you look so good!
I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.
So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your exfiancee's wedding.
Because I promised Mindy I would.
Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him.
Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the MaidofHonor.
And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.
Oohoh!
Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night.
Someone get a little action?
I may have.
Woohoo, stuud!
What's she look like?
Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.
Woohoo, geeek!
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy... Get out!
Nooo!
Well she totally called me on it, okay.
She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did.
Wow!
What's that like?
It's like this, me, no jokes.
All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.
Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way.
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Bye, Richard.
Bye sweetie, I love you.
I love you, too.
I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.
What are you talking about?
What wedding?
Come on, like you never talk about that.
Nooo!
Never!
I mean, we're living in the moment.
God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'
Afraid to ask him?
Could not be more terrified.
Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.
I was laughing at this quip leno made last night.

Broke up with her.
Oh, why?
Don't tell me.
Like crop circles or the Bermuda Triangle or evolution.
What, you don't believe in evolution?
Not really.
You don't believe in evolution?
I don't know.
It's just, you know... Monkeys, Darwin, it's a nice story.
I just think it's a little too easy.
"Too easy"?
Too The process of every living thing on this planet evolving... ...over millions of years from singlecelled organisms is "too easy"?
Yeah, I just don't buy it.
Excuse me.
Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe.
Evolution is scientific fact, like the air we breathe... ...like gravity.
Don't get me started on gravity.
You don't believe in gravity?
Well, it's not so much that, you know, I don't believe in it.
Lately I get the feeling that...
...I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
Pushed.
It's Isaac Newton and he's pissed.
How can you not believe in evolution?
I don't know, just don't.
Look at this funky shirt!
Pheebs, I've studied evolution my entire adult life.
And we've collected fossils from all over the world... ...that actually show the evolution of different species.
I mean, you can literally see them... ...evolving through time.
Really?
You can actually see it?
You bet!
In the U.S., China, Africa, all over!
See, I didn't know that.
Well, there you go.
So now the real question is, who put those fossils there and why?
Okay, Pheebs.
See how I'm making these little toys move?
Opposable thumbs!
Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
Maybe the Overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
Tell me you're joking.
Look, can't we say that you believe in something and I don't?
No, Pheebs, we can't.
No, what's that all about?
What is this obsessive need to make everybody agree with you?
I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
It's scary scientist man.
Okay, Phoebe, this is it.
In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts.
A briefcase of facts, if you will.
Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
Before you even start, I'm not denying evolution.
It's just one of the possibilities.
It's the only possibility.
Ross, could you just open your mind, like, this much?
Didn't the brightest minds in the world believe the Earth was flat?
And up till 50 years ago, you thought the atom was the smallest thing... ...until you split it open and this whole mess of crap came out.
Are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant... ...that you can't admit that there's a teeny, tiny possibility... ...that you could be wrong about this?
There might be... ...a teeny... ...tiny... ...possibility.
I can't believe you caved.
You just abandoned your whole belief system!
Before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you.
But... How are you gonna go into work tomorrow?
How are you going to face the other science guys?
How are you going to face yourself?
That was fun.

It's so good!
It's so good for Monica.
Time's up!
My turn.
That was half an hour?
It's your timer.
I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages.
All right, then massage me up right nice!
It's so good, isn't it?
I don't know what I did to deserve it.
Say goodbye to sore muscles!
Goodbye, muscles!
The One with Joey's Bag She gives the worst massages ever!
It was like she was torturing me for information.
I wanted to give it up.
I just didn't know what it was!
If it hurts that bad, you should tell her.
For the first time, I'm in a real relationship.
I won't screw that up by telling the truth.
Dude, look out!
You almost crushed my hat.
Sorry.
And the bunny got away.
This would be the place where you explain the hat.
There's this play... ...and I'm up for the part of this cool, suave, international guy.
A clotheshorse.
So I figure... ...everyone at the audition will wear ultrahip, highfashion stuff.
And you'll make them disappear?
Like you could find something this sophisticated.
Done!
If you want to look good, come to the store.
I'll help you.
Thanks!
Sure.
Please, take those off!
Hey, Phoebe.
You do seem a little tense.
Here, let me help you.
Get off!
Stop it!
Why are you doing that to me?
What are you talking about?
As a masseuse and a human...
...I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!
I give good massages.
I gave them to Rachel before she got allergic.
And Chandler, he loves them!
He's in pain!
No, he's not.
Yes, he is!
What?
I'm sorry, but You've been lying to me?
I can't believe that.
Maybe he didn't want to hurt you.
But the minute we start to lie to each other... And by "we"...
...I mean society.
Anytime you're ready.
Listen, I just wanted to apologize about the whole massage thing.
I really like them.
Please, stop!
We're supposed to be honest.
I wish you could tell me, "I don't like your massages."
I don't like your massages.
See?
It's no big deal.
But now you're crying!
I'm not crying about that.
I'm crying about something at work.
My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
You don't have to be best at everything.
Oh, my God!
You don't know me at all!
You give the worst massages in the world.
I'm crying here!
Look, hear me out.
You give the best badmassages.
If anybody was looking for the best badmassage... ...and they thought, "Who's the best?"
They'd have to go to you.
So you're saying that if there was an award... ...for the best badmassage... Who would get that?
It would be you!
You, Monica!
And you'd get all the votes.
So they could call the award, "The Monica"?
Absolutely.
I suck!
Thank you for meeting me.
But you came to see Lilly?
Yeah.
Why?
Lilly's dead.
Can I ask you something?
Okay, you can totally say no... ...but would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
With who?
My friend Bonnie.
She always thought Ross was cute... ...and she asked if I could set it up.
But if that's not cool...
Which one is Bonnie?
You remember her from my birthday party?
Average height... ...medium build, bald... That's fine.
Really?
Ross and the bald girl?
That was depressing.
I just bought a pretzel... ...from one of the kids from Fame.
Ready to go to the movies?
Oh, this is Bonnie!
Hi!
This is Bonnie?
This is Bonnie?
You're Bonnie?
I can show you an ID.
If you want.
Oh, no.
You look a lot different than the last time I saw you.
Oh, yeah.
Well, I just started wearing bras again.
Oh, that must be it.
Have fun tonight.
Thanks.
You too.
You said she was bald.
She was bald.
She's not now.
How could you not tell me she has hair?
I don't know.
I hardly ever say that about people.
Oh, well, this is just perfect!
Well, I'm sorry.
I thought you said it was okay.
I said it was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick.
That girl has got hair all over her head!
Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
Does she have a bad personality?
Oh, no, Bonnie's the best!
Bing, you're okay.
Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant... ...or inside his shower drain?
Oh, my God.
Look.
It's Ross and that girl.
Look at that!
It's a line of ants!
They're working as a team!
Right.
Oh, yeah.
It looks like Ross is breaking up with her.
I hope he lets her down easy.
Look at that!
They are not breaking up!
Look at them!
You know what that is?
A second date, that's what that is.
Look, she just put her hand on his thigh.
That's nothing.
She's very sexually aggressive.
Oh, God!
It's your fault.
Now he loves her.
He'll marry her.
It's all your fault.
You said it was okay.
You said she was bald!
Was!
Was, was, was!
We can't let it happen.
We have to do something.
We have to break them up.
Just go in there and shave her head!
You owe me one bald girl!
Okay, first of all, breathe.
Second of all, I don't get it.
Aren't you the one that decided you didn't want to be with Ross?
Yes.
Well, isn't he your friend?
Don't you want him to be happy?
So?
It's just, you know, I didn't expect him to be this happy so soon.
Oh, no.
What?
We killed them all!
You know what I was thinking?
What?
Nothing, I just like to go like this.
What are you doing tonight?
Do you have a lecture?
No, why?
Then, free as a bird.
What's up?
My dad wants to know if you want to play racquetball.
Great!
Dad must like you!
He doesn't ask just anyone to play.
He didn't ask for you.
He asked for "Chauncey."
I assumed he meant you.
Did you correct him?
No, I thought it would be more fun this way.
Cool!
Maybe you could do this every week.
Or you could sit on the porch... ...and make sure no one steals the trashcans.
He does that every week too.
Just so you know, you have to let him win.
He hates to lose.
Maybe I'll play with my left hand.
You're not a lefty?
Does anybody know me?
Hey.
How was it?
Well, I had a great time.
Chauncey, on the other hand...
I will tell the story.
It was going great.
I let him win, we were bonding... ...he even said I could call him Dad.
And what did he ask you not to call him?
Daddy.
Look, here's the story.
We had just finished playing, and we were gonna take a steam.
I walk into the room... ...and it's really steamy.
So I take off my glasses, and that's when it happened.
Guys?
Over here.
Have a seat, son.
Hey!
Oh, my God!
I can't believe it.
I know.
You gave my father a lap dance.
Why do they put so much steam in there?
Because otherwise they'd have to call it the "room" room.
Why?
Why did that have to happen?
Come on, it's not that big a deal.
Not that big a deal?
There was touching of things.
I know you wanted to bond with my dad... ...but did you have to bond to that part?
I'm sure Dad doesn't care.
He probably thought it was funny.
He'll be telling this story for years.
I don't want him to tell this story for years.
Oh, but he will.
He still tells the story about how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
I wasn't escaping.
Then how'd you get caught in the barbed wire?
I was trying to help out a squirrel.
You were trying to eat it.
If that is your father calling to tell this story... ...then the marriage is off!
Come on.
Hello.
I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.
I'll call you later, Dad.
I love you.
I'm off to see your dad.
Aren't you a little overdressed?
You better make sure he tips you this time.
I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore... ...and I figured the best way to do that was face to face.
And by "face," I don't mean his lap.
And by "face," I don't mean my ass.
Are you getting Monica and Chandler a present?
I don't know.
You know, they didn't get us anything.
Thank you!
So you understand.
I'd feel better if you didn't tell what happened.
I'm a little embarrassed about it.
I understand completely.
Nothing's scarier than embarrassing yourself in front of your inlaws.
As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy, I was unemployed.
Her father asked me what I did for a living.
I said I was a lawyer.
What'd you do when they found out?
They never did.
So if you ever see me giving them legal advice, just nod along.
Shall we?
So, I guess we wear swimsuits in here.
I'm my dad
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to do that.
This is the nine millionth ring store, and I can't find the perfect ring.
Ugly ring, ugly ring, ugly ring...
It's a beautiful selection.
So maybe you don't get her a ring.
Maybe you do something different.
An engagement bracelet or an engagement tiara!
An engagement Revolutionary War musket!
I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.
Imagine getting down on one knee... and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
I'll stick with the ring.
This one's nice.
I like it.
Sir?
Kind sir, can I see this one?
This is why you brought me.
I know how to haggle.
Let me handle this from here.
Can I help you?
I would like to see that ring.
Or not.
Whatever.
This ring is from the 1920s.
It's a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires.
Sir, could I ask you...?
Could you hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
Okay.
Okay.
Will you marry me?
Oh, my God, that's it!
That's the ring!
How much is it?
I will handle this.
How much is it?
$8600.
We will give you $10.
Are you interested in this ring?
Yes.
But I can only pay $8000.
Okay.
I can let it go for 8.
We stand firm at $10.
How would you like to pay?
Credit card.
Oh, no!
I lent my credit card to Joey.
I'll go get it.
You guard the ring.
Listen, I'm sorry about before.
Do you have anything here for $10?
Yes.
I have these two rather beautiful... fivedollar bills.
I'll give you $1 for them.
I'd also like to try on the tiara.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
What do you think?
Too much?
A tad.
Take the tiara back... and let me hold the musket again.
Something's missing.
Let me see the ring that my friend picked out.
Where's the 1920s princesscut ring?
I just sold it to that gentleman.
Oh, my God!
Wait, no!
Let me out!
Now!
Rachel?
No.
How are you, Paul?
Okay.
Chandler... did your dad ever hug you?
No.
Did he hug you?
No!
No.
It's just that my dad never did.
I miss my dad.
You can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
Hey, Chandler?
Yeah?
Would you...?
Would you hug me?
I'm a little busy here, Paul.
That's what my dad used to say.
Okay.
A quick one.
Come on, hug it out.
There you go.
Okay.
Five more seconds..
Okay!
Joey!
What?
Hey, what..?
Hi.
Paul, is it?
Do you have my credit card?
Yeah.
It's in my...
In my pocket.
My back pocket!
Thank God.
Get me a musket and we'll talk
Ross, it's Nana.
How you doing?
Hey, Dad.
How's she doing?
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
How are you, Mom?
Me?
I'm fine, fine.
I'm glad you're here.
What's with your hair?
What?
What's different?
Nothing.
Oh, maybe that's it.
She's unbelievable.
Her mother's.
Okay, relax.
We are gonna be here a while, it looks like.
We still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
Oh, God!
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
Yeah, they were gross.
You know what I love?
Her Sweet 'N Lows.
How she was always stealing them from restaurants.
Not just from restaurants, from our house.
Mrs. Geller?
She looks so small.
I know.
Well, at least she's with PopPop and Aunt Phyllis now.
Goodbye, Nana.
Bye, Nana.
Nurse!
What is going on?
You know how the nurse said Nana had passed?
Well, she's not quite.
What?
She's not passed!
She's present!
She's back!
What's going on?
She may have died.
"She may have died"?
We're looking into it.
I'll go see.
This almost never happens.
Now she's passed.
I just have to know, okay?
Is it my hair?
Yes, that's exactly what it is.
It's your hair.
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
So did she?
Twice.
Oh, that sucks.
You guys okay?
I don't know.
It's weird.
I know she's gone, but I just don't feel.
Maybe she's not really gone.
No, no, she's gone.
We checked.
A lot.
No, I mean, maybe no one ever really goes.
Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get this feeling that she's, like, right here, you know?
And Debbie, my best friend from junior high got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course.
I always get this strong Debbie vibe whenever I use a little yellow pencil.
I miss her.
Here, Pheebs.
Want this?
Oh, thanks.
Sure.
I just sharpened her this morning.
I don't believe any of that.
I think when you're dead, you're dead.
You're gone.
You're worm food.
So Chandler looks gay, huh?
I don't know who this is, but it's not Debbie.

If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain forest.
And bigger boobs.
Well, see, you took mine.
What about you?
If I were omnipotent for a day, I'd make myself omnipotent forever.
There's always one guy.
"If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes. "
Hey, Joey.
What would you do if you were omnipotent?
Probably kill myself.
Excuse me?
If little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live.
Joey, omnipotent.
You are?
Ross, I'm.
The One With George Stephanopoulos How does she do that?
I cannot sleep in a public place.
Would you look at her?
She's so peaceful.
What?
It's okay.
You just nodded off again.
What's going on?
I got no sleep last night.
My grandmother has this new boyfriend and they're both kind of insecure in bed, so.
And deaf.
They're constantly reassuring each other they're having a good time.
You have no idea how loud they are.
You can stay with Rachel and me.
Thanks.
95, 96, 97.
See, I told you.
Less than 1 00 steps from our place to here.
You got way too much free time, man.
There's the birthday boy.
Check it out.
Hockey tickets.
RangersPenguins tonight and we're taking you.
Happy birthday!
We love you, man.
It's funny.
My birthday was seven months ago.
So?
I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide who got to bring a date?
Well, aren't we Mr. "The Glass is Half Empty. "
Oh, my God!
Is today the 20th?
October 20th?
I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
What's wrong with the 20th?
Eleven days before Halloween?
All the good costumes are gone?
Today's the day Carol and I first consummated our physical relationship.
Sex.
I better pass on the game.
I'm just gonna go home and think about my exwife and her lesbian lover.
The hell with hockey!
Let's all do that!
Come on, Ross!
You, me, Joey, ice!
Guys night out!
Come on, what do you say, big guy?
Huh?
What are you doing?
I have no idea.
Come on, Ross.
All right.
Maybe it will take my mind off it.
Promise to buy me a big foam finger?
You got it.
I remember when I got my first paycheck.
There was a cavein in a mine, and eight people were killed.
You worked in a mine?
No, I worked at a Dairy Queen.
Why?
Isn't this exciting?
I earned this.
I wiped tables for it.
I steamed milk for it.
And it was totally not worth it.
Who's FICA?
Why's he getting all my money?
I mean, what?
Chandler, look at that.
This is not that bad.
You're fine for a first job.
You can totally, totally live on this.
By the way, great service today.
It's the VISAcard people.
I'm done.
Yeah, well, you know what?
So is Sorentino's.
I'm sorry.
Why don't we find someplace else?
It's late.
Everything will be closed.
We'll do it another night.
No, no, we won't.
We won't?
Come on.
Okay, that's dead, right?
What are we doing?
Do you want Cranapple or CranGrape?
Grape.
Okay, now... ...sit.
Oh, my God!
Billions of years ago, Earth was only Sorry.
So what are we looking at?
Well, you see that little cluster of stars next to the big one?
That is Ursa Major.
Really?
No idea.
It could be.
Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Oh, that's okay.
You were worth the wait.
And I don't just mean tonight.
You're not laughing.
This time it's not so funny.
Oh, God!
Honey?
That's okay.
What?
Oh, no.
You just rolled over the juice box.
Thank God!
Hey, you.
I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.
I know.
It is pretty unbel We're not alone.
You believe what a jerk Ross was being?
Yeah, I know.
He can get really competitive.
What?
"Hello, Kettle, this is Monica.
You're black! "
Please!
I am not as bad as Ross.
I beg to differ.
The Pictionary incident?
That was not an incident.
I was gesturing and the plate slipped out of my hand.
I got an interview!
You're kidding!
Where?
Saks Fifth Avenue!
It's like the mother ship is calling you home.
What's the job?
Assistant buyer!
I would be shopping for a living!
That's Aunt Iris.
This woman's been playing poker since she was 5.
You've got to listen to every word she says.
Is Tony Randall dead?
I don't think so.
He may be now.
I think I hit him with my car.
My God!
Really?
No, that's bluffing!
Lesson one!
Let me tell you something.
Everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap!
Nice earrings.
Thank you.
Girls, sit down!
Aunt Iris, this is Phoebe, and that's Rachel.
Listen, I am parked at a meter.
Let's do it.
Ross, could we please, please, listen to anything else?
All right.
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
Guys, guess what, guess what?
The fifth dentist caved, and now they all recommend Trident?
No, the interview!
She loved me.
She absolutely loved me.
We talked for two and a half hours.
We have the same taste in clothes.
And I went to camp with her cousin.
And the job is perfect!
I can do this well!
That's great!
God!
And she told the funniest story.
Great, you'll tell us and we'll laugh!
Let's play poker!
Listen, we talked about it and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.
We can play some other game.
Like Pictionary?
Very funny.
We'd give poker another try.
Shall we, ladies?
Yes, I think we should.
Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
That's okay, I'm gonna give it a go.
So Pheebs owes 7.50.
Monica, you owe $ 1 0.00.
And, Rachel, you owe 1 5 big ones!
Thanks for teaching us "Crossedeyed Mary. "
We gotta play that other way.
Here's my 7.50, but you should know that this money is cursed.
What?
I cursed it!
So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
I'll take it.
Bad things happen to me anyway.
This way, I can break them up with a movie.
So that just leaves the big Greene poker machine, who owes 1 5.
It's so typical: "I'm a man!
I have a penis!
I have to win money to exert my power over women! "
You know, this isn't over.
We will play you again.
And we will win and you will lose.
And you will beg and we will laugh.
And we will take every last dime you have.
And you will hate yourselves forever!
Kind of stepped on my point there, Monica!
You know what I just realized?
Maybe I'll play it with a mustache.
Storage rooms give me the creeps.
Please hurry up, honey.
If you want little round waffles, wait till I find the iron.
I want the little round waffles.
Here it is!
Right underneath the can of bug bomb.
Is the best place to put something that cooks food underneath poison?
You know what?
I'll have toast.
You guys!
We were in the storage area, and we saw this creepy man.
It was this crazyeyed, hairy beastman.
It was like a Big Foot or a yeti or something.
He came at us, so Rachel used a bug bomb on him.
I pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass.
Like, dark hair, bushy beard?
Yeah, you fogged Danny.
Please!
We did not fog Danny.
Who's Danny?
Danny just moved in.
He just got back from a fourmonth trek in the Andes.
Nice fella.
He's nice.
You know, you always... ...stick up for the people we fog.
You might not remember us, but we're the girls that fogged you.
We're really sorry we fogged you.
Just so you know, we didn't mean to fog you.
We thought you were like a yeti or something.
Sorry to bother you, but we can't accept your acceptance of our apology.
It doesn't really seem like you mean it.
That guy is so rude!
Really!
What is with that guy?
You'd forgive me if I fogged you.
You did, a little bit.
Oh, my God, honey.
I'm so sorry.
I totally forgive you.
Yeti?
Danny?
I had to cut my hair to get rid of... ...the fogger smell.
Listen, I'm so sorry.
I would have never fogged you... ...if you hadn't looked so...
Absolutely.
Some people are just into appearances.
What?
It's cool.
No, that is not cool.
You don't even know me.
You got the shopping bags and the Saks catalog.
From that, you've got me all figured out?
Well, you don't.
You know, I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here.
Do you?
You know, if kids like to play with capri pants.
Stop saying that.
I hate that!
I judged you.
I made a snap judgment.
But you did it too, and you're worse.
You're sticking to your judgment.
You can't even open your mind to see you might be wrong.
What does that say about you?
That pizza place across the street any good?
I'm hungry.
You want some pizza?
You can keep yelling.
Stop saying that.
I hate that.
It's not like I'm wearing a seeingeye dog coat!
Listen, you know what, I'm not feeling really well..   and I don't think I'm gonna get to go to the play.
Really?
What's wrong?
I don't know.
I think it's kind of serious.
You know, I was watching this thing on TV this morning..   about Newcastle disease, and I think I might have it.
Newcastle disease is a secretionborne virus..   that only affects chickens and other poultry.
Okay, who's this?
I'm sorry.
Rachel, this is Charlie Wheeler.
She's a colleague.
Hi.
Well, I would shake your hand..   but I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease.
Rachel, can I see you for a second?
Sure.
You're not sick.
What?
Yes, I am!
Okay, then why are you all dressed up?
When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better.
You just want to stay home so you can make a move on Joey.
No, I heard you before.
That is so not what this is.
Okay, then what is this?
Okay.
Joey is having a secret Days of Our Lives party up on the roof.
And he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you.
What?!
What?
What's going on?
He didn't want you to know about it, but I came over here to tell you.
You came to say you were sick.
All right, professor or detective?
Wait, Joey's having a party, and he wasn't gonna invite us?
He does it every year.
That's why he's sending you to the play.
That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory.
And that horrible museum tour?
No, I arranged that.
Hey, you guys, I'm turning in.
Have fun.
We know about your party, Joey.
What party?
The game's over.
Take off your robe.
Okay, I mean..   Close it up!
Close it up!
Nice to meet you.
Hey, you made it!
All right!
Glad you could make it.
Thanks for coming.
Oh, my God.
Kyle Lowder!
Hi.
I love you!
Hey.
That's why I didn't invite you.
You have to calm down, all right?
Just go get yourself a drink or something.
Oh, yeah, that's what you want.
My inhibitions lowered.
Oh, my God, can you believe we're surrounded by all this?
I can barely control myself.
Monica, you might want to remember that you're married.
Where is Chandler anyway?
Oh, my God!
Chandler!
Where the hell is everybody?
Why Don't You Like Me?
Chapter 1: My First Period.
Hey, Joey said no autographs.
I bet you're thinking that now would be a great time for an intermission, huh?
Oh, yes.
God, yes.
Well, you're not gonna get one!
Because in life, there are no intermissions, people!
Now, Chapter 7: Divorce is a FourLetter Word!
How could he leave me?!
I don't know.
You seem lovely.
Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.
This was a really important experience for me and I wanted to share it with you.
You're so wonderful.
Why Don't You Like Me?
Chapter 1: My First Period.
I can't believe you guys bought that.
Enjoy your slow death

Googlie Worm.
And this?
Glow Pop Jiggly Jam.
It's so funny!
What's this?
A hunk of sandwich from last year.
Geller's got one hooked!
Looks like a big one!
It's the classic struggle between man Someone knocked over a lamp.
You know what'll be great about the fishing trip?
When my Dad asks, "What are you doing with your life?"...
...I can say, "I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston.
What about you?"
Don't stop having fun just because I'm here.
Kathy didn't cheat on all of you.
Well, except you.
You shouldn't leave Chandler alone.
They broke up only two days ago.
Go fishing next week.
There's nothing I can do.
He's still in his sweats.
That's only phase one.
I'll be back for phase two.
I'd never miss that.
Phase two?
Getting drunk and going to a strip club.
How does going there make him better?
There are naked ladies there.
Then to phase three: seeing yourself with other women.
There are naked ladies there too.
Would you give me one minute, please?
The One with Joey's Dirty Day These will match the jacket you picked out last week?
I can't believe Kathy did this to me.
I really thought she was the one.
I'll tell you what.
I'm not getting out of this chair.
Ever!
From now on, this chair is the one!
You know what else is the one?
My sweatpants.
Just take the sweats off, okay?
Take them off and we'll have some fun.
Wow, and I can't resist that line.
Did you catch any fish?
You guys have no idea.
You stink!
Are you kidding?
Three days without a shower.
Plus, I fell in a big tub of worms!
How's he doing?
He hasn't left that chair in two days.
Hey, buddy, how's it going?
You see?
He just needed his pal to come home.
I got to memorize my lines.
Me and Charlton Heston, bright and early tomorrow, baby!
How you doing?
Who in the hell are you?
Would you believe me if I said I was Kirk Douglas?
Put some pants on, kid, so I can kick your butt.
No, wait.
You don't understand.
I'm an actor.
Joey Tribbiani.
I'm doing a scene with you today.
And I stink!
You're in this picture?
I'm a cop who won't work with you because you're a loose cannon.
Anyway, I'm really sorry.
But I stink.
Joey, right?
Every actor, one time or another Every actor thinks he stinks.
Even Laurence Olivier sometimes thought he stank.
Bob Redford won't even watch himself.
You don't understand.
Listen to me.
I don't know one actor worth his salt... ...who, one time in his career, didn't say, "God, I stink!"
I just did a scene out there.
First take, I stunk the place up.
The important thing, and you must remember... ...no matter how badly you think you stink... ...you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower!
Do you understand me?
Yes, sir.
I'm very sorry.
Wait a minute!
Take your pants.
For me, it would have to be Chantal.
I'm done.
Read mine.Okay.
I see a ladder.
Which can mean either a promotionor a violent death.
I'm the head chef.I can't get promoted.
Who's next?
I'm done.
Do mine.
Okay.
Oh!
Okay, I see a circle.
Which can either meanyou're having a baby..   or you'll makea scientific discovery!
Well, I have been spendinga lot of time in the lab.
What does yours say, Pheebs?All right.
Wow!
Yay!
Oh, I'm gonna meet a guy!And really soon!
He's gonna be the man of my dreams.
Probably not the guyI had a dream about last night.
Has anyone seen my shirt?
It's a buttondown, likea faded salmon color?
You mean your pink shirt?
Faded salmon color?
No, I haven't seen your pink shirt.
I must have left it at Mona's.I knew it!
I'm sure you can get another oneat Ann Taylor's.
That's my favorite shirt.I love it.
Ask Mona to give it back.
I don't know.
I could.
We didn't really end thingson good terms.
If I went, I'd be ignoring theone thing she asked me to do..   jump up my own ass and die.
Oh, wait a second, you guys?
Okay, if I were a salmon shirt,where would I be?
Upstream.
Damn, nobody's herefor my good ones.
I am so sorry I spilled wineall over your shirt.
It's okay.No, it's still wet.
Let me get it out before it sets.I have something you could wear.
Here.
I don't know if I want to weara woman's shirt.
That's a man's shirt.Awfully pink.
Oh, my God!
Ross!Hello!
What are you doing?
Not touching myself, if that makesanyone less uncomfortable.
Item J437A.
Color: winterberry.
Hi, listen.Come here.
Come..
I'm so, so sorry about yesterday.
Anyway, Mona, I'm really, really sorry.It's just..
Listen, you don't have to apologize.I understand why you were there.
You do?Yeah.
You still have feelings for me.
To be honest,I still have feelings for you.
I wish we could work it out,but we can't.
It's too complicated with youand Rachel and the baby.
I just..
It just wasn't meant to be.
Oh, God.
You're right.
Ross, we have to be strong.
Okay, I'm gonna go.
Can I?
To remember you?
No
I can't believe you guys think you're moving in here.
Well, believe it, baby!
Well, I'm not moving.
What?
No.
It was a stupid bet.
We were just playing a game.
You can't ignore the bet.
It's a bet!
Bet on a bet and if you lose, you lose the bet.
We have to move.
We would have made them get rid of the birds.
I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better... ...this is all your fault.
What?
Chanandler Bong!
We steal that TV Guide every week!
I knew it!
I don't care.
I'm not going anywhere.
Cool!
Girl roommate.
Well?
Nope, not knocked up yet.
It's only been a couple hours.
Meanwhile, I'll do whatever I can to help this.
I'm just going to, you know, lie in your chair, okay?
Good.
I'm going to let gravity do its job.
Can you give me a hand?
Put that box down!
We are not going anywhere!
This is my apartment and I like it!
This is a girl's apartment!
That is a boy's apartment!
And look, it's purple!
I tell you, you with your steady hand, I am not moving.
And now I have got the steady hand.
Okay, okay.
I'll take care of it.
That's right.
You do what the hand says!
How'd it go?
I lost our mattresses.
Are you in there, little fetus?
In nine months will you come greet us?
I will buy you some Adidas We were just at the drugstore so we got you a little present.
You are mean boys who are just being mean!
Don't get mad!
No one forced you to raise the stakes.
That is not true!
She forced me!
You got the question wrong.
It was a stupid, unfair question!
Don't blame the questions!
Stop yelling in our apartment!
You are ruining moving day for us.
Stop calling it your apartment!
It is!
You're going to have a baby.
They're going to have a baby!
My sister's going to have my baby!
Okay, but this can't be good for the baby.
I can't find garbage bags.
I think I saw some in here.
What is it?
I don't know.
But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.
I can't believe we're living here!
What is it?
Did you see the size of the closets?
I can't believe we live here
You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at lnnsbruck in '7 6.
Amusebouche?
Talk to me.
A weird thing happened to me on the train this morning.
Talk dirty.
Here?
Come on.
Come on.
Say something hot!
What?
What?
Vulva.
"Vulva?"
All right, I panicked, all right?
She took me by surprise.
But it wasn't a total loss.
I mean, we ended up cuddling.
Whoa, you cuddled?
How many times?
Shut up.
It was nice.
I just don't think I'm the dirtytalking kind of guy.
Just say what you want to do to her.
Or what you want her to do to you.
Or what you think other people might be doing to each other.
Look, I tell you what.
Try something on me.
Please be kidding.
Why not?
Come on.
Just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
I'm in my apartment.
Yeah, what else?
You're not there.
We're not having this conversation!
All right.
I'll start.
Joey, please.
Come on, come on.
All right, ready?
Oh, Ross you get me so hot, I want your lips on me now.
See?
Now you say something.
I really don't think so.
Come on.
You like this woman?
You wanna see her again?
Sure.
If you can't talk dirty to me, how will you talk dirty to her?
Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
Okay, turn around.
I don't want you staring at me while I do this.
All right, all right.
I'm not looking.
Go ahead.
Okay.
I want.
Okay, I want to feel your hot, soft skin with my lips.
There you go.
Keep going, keep going.
I want to take my tongue and.
Say it.
Say it!
Run it all over your body until you're trembling with.
With?
Funny story.
You're not gonna believe this.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Yes, Fran, I know what time it is but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
I need to borrow some money.
Oh, sure.
Yeah, how much?
Two thousand dollars?
Yes, $2000 exactly.
How did you know that?
I know how much you used to make, and I know how much your rent is.
Oh, okay.
I am on fire.
Listen, this is really nice.
Did you write a check to Monica for $2000?
Did Monica borrow money from you?
Kind of.
I can't believe her.
Did she tell you we were having money problems?
No, no, no.
It wasn't because of your money problems.
It was for something for her.
What?
Something personal.
What would she get for $2000 that she wouldn't tell me about?
Excuse me.
Boob job.
What?
That's ridiculous.
She doesn't need a boob job.
A boob job?
She doesn't need that.
That's crazy.
Well, it's not that crazy, okay?
Making them smaller, that would be crazy.
Hey, Rach.
There she is, my perfectly proportioned wife.
Don't look at me.
I never get his jokes.
Thank you?
No, no.
Don't thank me.
Thank you.
Do you know there is not one thing I would change about you?
Not one single thing.
And definitely not..   two single things.
Okay, you're being weird.
Do you want sex, or did you do something bad?
No.
No.
No.
I just love the way you look.
I am warm..   for your form.
Okay, you know the old classics like, you know, "You look nice"?
They're still okay.
But "you look nice" could mean that I'm saying, "Your face looks nice."
I want to compliment your body.
I mean, I wouldn't change it at all.
And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
Okay.
I mean..   you wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger, would you?
Don't answer that.
Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any weirder.
Why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
I don't know.
I mean, what brought that on?
Oh, my God.
You know what, we're trying to get pregnant..   so he's probably starting to freak out that my body's gonna change.
You think that's what it is?
You heard him.
"No bigger.
You're perfect.
Just don't get any bigger."
My God, he sounded just like my highschool wrestling coach.
I'm gonna have to talk to Chandler.
Yeah.
If you don't, I will.
Of course your body's gonna change.
Your breasts are gonna get bigger..   your ass is gonna get bigger..   you're gonna lose bladder control.
Let's solve one problem at a time.
Hey, Rach.
Perfection.
Wouldn't change a thing.
Not a thing.
Honey?
Yeah?
About that.
I'm going to change.
Yes, but, honey, you don't have to.
I'm gonna get bigger.
Honey, I..
I love your breasts the way they are.
Fascist.
My breasts are gonna get bigger whether you like it or not.
And it's not just my breasts.
My ass is gonna get bigger too.
Your ass?!
And don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too.
They do that?
It's kind of a package deal.
God, why?
Why would you want to do that to yourself?
I thought it was something that we both wanted.
If it means that much to you, I may be able to get onboard with the boobs..   but the giant ass and the big clown feet?
Oh, my God, Chandler.
If you can't handle this, what will you be like in the hospital..   with the blood and screaming and the little person that's shooting out of her?
If you can't handle this, what will you be like in the hospital..   with the blood and screaming and the little person that's shooting out of her?
What?
Joey, why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
Because she is.
Chandler knows I borrowed the money.
For your boob job.
Joe..
It's over.
Okay, so I'm out $4000 and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?
I know the other day in the coffeehouse..   you were all caught up in the whole soccermom thing..   but is that really you?
Please take these off.
I swear I won't scratch.
No, sorry, hon.
Monica's orders.
Well, that wasn't easy.
Okay, dinner's on.
There's a peach cobbler warming in the oven.
So the plate's gonna be hot, but that shouldn't be a problem for you.
All right, you kids.
Bye, now.
Bye.
Oh, look, look.
A lowbudget puppet show.
A shame you can't see what finger I'm holding up.
Wine?
Please.
Spilled some.
I got it.
You look beautiful tonight.
What?
Sorry.
You look beautiful.
You know what?
That's it.
That's it.
Oh, yes.
Good.
Oh, my God.
You're a freak!
How about that?
Where're you shipping off to?
I really can't say.
Do you have nuclear weapons onboard?
I can't say.
Do you get to look through a periscope thingy?
I'm sorry, but I can't say.
Wow, it's neat learning about submarines.
I better not miss my flight.
I'll walk you out.
Bye, Ryan.
Pleasure.
Take care.
So do you think we could get you one of those uniform things?
You like that, do you?
Oh, yeah.
I'll make some calls.
Can you believe that's how we spent our two weeks?
We didn't do the romantic things I'd planned... ...like having a picnic in Central Park and coffee at Central Perk.
Oh, I just got that!
Taxi!
Bye, you.
I'm sorry, we're Hey, sailor.
Is this what you had in mind?
I'll say.
I'm shipping out tomorrow.
Well, then... ...we better make this night count.
Wait, I forgot to turn off the cappuccino machine.
Anchors aweigh.
Oh, wait, wait!
My purse, my purse!
I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.
Why don't I just meet you upstairs?
Honey
Hey, hey, hey, don't mind if I do.
I'm sorry, sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention.
You feel like going to a convention?
We can't.
We're not pharmacists.
I know we're not..   but Frank Madaio and Eva..    Kate Miller.
Kate Miller it is.
Okay.
Oh, good..   And that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
Well, in that case, should I make sure it's on real good?
Thank you.
Oh, and then you said that thing about bringing the Mesozoic Era..   into the 21st century.
Well, yeah.
That's it?
That's it.
That's the whole speech.
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
We did it.
Actually, I did it, Ross.
You remembered shockingly little of your own speech.
Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products.
Oh, this is amazing.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
That's a pretty necklace.
Thank you.
Hey, what do you say we celebrate?
Champagne?
Yeah!
Save the cork, and that way, we can fill the bottle with water..   and put it back so they don't charge you.
Oh, my God, I love you.
This is such a cute picture of Emma.
And is this your son..   or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation?
That's Ben, my son from my first marriage.
Your first marriage?
Yeah.
You've been married more than once?
No.
So why'd you break up?
Oh, it was..
It's complicated, you know?
She was..   gay.
Actually, it's not that complicated.
Oh, my God.
This is so cool!
Okay.
Odd thing to get excited about.
No, it's just that I was engaged to a guy who turned out to be gay.
Hey!
Highfive!
Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs?
My fiance was always going on long weekends with his "tennis partner."
My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with every day for a year.
She didn't get any fitter.
Everybody's like, "I knew all along."
I know.
If you knew, why didn't you tell me?
I mean, call, leave a note.
"Hi.
Just dropped by to say your wife's gay."
I know.
And then..   And then you try to make the best of a bad situation..   so you float the idea of a threesome.
I didn't do that.
Me neither.
Well, who knew?
Pharmacists are fun.
I know.
That old lady at the end was ready to take you home.
Not enough pills in the world, Rach.
What about you, huh?
You're the single one.
See anybody in there you like?
Well, let's see.
There was that really big guy that I was talking to..   with the really nice breasts.
But what about back home?
Anything going on there?
Anybody you like?
No.
There is.
You're blushing.
No, I'm not blushing..   and I'm sunburned.
From, you know, the rain.
You like someone.
Tell me who.
Tell me who it is.
Come on.
No.
Joey.
Who do you like?
You're not getting away that easy.
Who do you like?
Joey, come on!
It doesn't matter, you know?
It's not like anything's gonna happen.
What?
Why not?
Rach, who can you not get?
Okay.
Okay.
You really want to know who it is?
Yeah.
Who is it?
Do you?
Oh, hey.
I just left you a message.
Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite..   but now that you're here, we could have that dinner.
Right!
Of course.
Hey, did you guys finish the speech?
Yep!
We got it.
We got it.
Thank you so much.
I had a great time.
Yeah.
This isn't over, because I really want to know..   Later.
Later.
So shall we?
Yeah.
Okay.
Good night.
You've each won a game, and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life.
I'm not saying it was a bad movie.
I'm just saying it was a little... ...hard to follow.
I told you there'd be subtitles.
I know.
I just didn't want to wear my glasses on our first date.
Monica?
It would help when I'm kissing if you didn't shout my sister's name.
Honey, I'm just checking.
Monica?
Mon?
What?
I'm sorry.
It's just, when you moved your hands down to my butt... ...it was, like, "Whoa!
Ross' hands are on my butt!"
And that's funny.
Why?
Well, it's not.
I'm sorry.
I guess I'm just nervous.
I mean, it's you.
You know, it's us.
We're crossing that line.
It's sort of a big thing.
Well, I know it's big.
I just didn't know it was haha big.
Okay, my hands were nowhere near your butt.
I know, I know, I know!
I was thinking about when they were there the last time.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Okay, look!
I promise.
I won't laugh anymore.
Put your hands back there.
No, see, now I can't.
I feel selfconscious.
Come on, touch my butt.
Just one cheek The moment's gone.
I'll back up into your hands.
That's romantic.
Touch it.
No.
Oh, come on, squeeze it.
No!
Rub it?
Oh, come on!
Would you just grab my ass?
Wow!
Look at that!
The car is on fire... ...yet somehow its expensive paint job... ...is protected by the Miracle Wax.
You've got a Cheeto on your face, man.
Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?
That was 14 hours ago.
Have you ever been, you know, fooling around with a girl... ...and she started laughing?
But it was 1982... ...and my Flock of Seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.
She laughed at you?
It could be worse, could be naked.
I've been wanting this since ninth grade typing.
And I just want it to be perfect... ...and right and... Why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?
It's the Miracle Wax!
It certainly is a miracle.
Hi, you guys.
Listen, I was thinking about... Can you guys speak up?
It's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.
I'm sorry about last night.
I really want to make it up to you.
There's no need to make it up How?
Well, I was thinking maybe a romantic dinner... ...with candles and wine.
And then maybe going back to my place... ...for dessert.
That sounds... ...perfect?
What's this?
Would you get us a couple of beers?
I'm going to look into your eyes now.
Care for a cherry?
No, thanks.
I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
You okay?
You all right?
Give me a hand with the zipper.
Up!
You changed?
I decided I needed my lucky dress.
Lucky means more cleavage?
It does for me.
Look at him!
He's so cute.
I just want to grab him and kiss him.
How could I kiss him without him knowing I like him?
I know how you can get him.
Take off your bra.
What?
This scene in Footloose Flashdance.
Yeah.
With that plumber girl?
A welder.
Were you, like, in the movie?
She takes off her bra under the shirt and pulls it out the sleeve.
Very sexy.
And classy.
Or you could use mistletoe.
It's not Christmas.
Spinthebottle.
He's not 11.
Thank you so much for this.
It was so thoughtful of you.
You're leaving?
We have something we have to get to.
I'm gonna take off too.
You can't leave yet.
You have to stay.
We've got the whole big thing planned.
What big thing?
Spinthebottle works like this: I spin the bottle.
Lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther.
All right.
Who wants to go first?
I'll go.
Welcome to America.
Oh, my God!
Two in a row!
You gotta use your tongues now.
All right.
I have a dentist.
I'll put some ice on it.
Excuse me.
What do I do now?
I think you're done.
Time to take off the bra.
That was really great.
But I gotta take off.
Take the bra off.
Let's go get your coat.
Rachel's my girlfriend.
So this was really fun.
You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
What?
Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money   They did!
Yes~  It was the weirdest thing.
Zelner called me and he said  we will do anything we can to get you back  and that I should thank some "Ron".
I don't even know  what department that guy is in  So... what are you gonna do?
Well, I took it  That's great.
so you are staying in New York     You are excited, right?
Yeah..  You know, the money's great.
It's certainly the easier choice.
Right  Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris?
Sure..   You know.. was I excited about working in the  Fashion capital of the world?
Ooh..
Absolutely   Yeah.. but you know, this is.. it's fine..
I'm fine going back  to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything  out of that I possibly can?
Uhm, I hadn't no you..
I had no idea you were so excited about Paris  Uhm I mean.. you said you were scared  Well.. yeah..
I mean, it was good scared though..  you know, like.. like when I moved to NY, scared  or... when I found out I was gonna have Emma,  scared..  but.. this's fine.. this's gonna be good.
You should go  What?
It's what you want, you should go  You really think so?
I really do  But I already told Zelner that I would come back  I'm sure he'll understand    All right!
All right!
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna go to Paris   Yeah     Yeah!!
I'm going to Paris!
Thank you Ross.
I'm so happy!
Then I'm happy too..
Thank you all for comming  We are here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent   and a beautiful woman   inside..  As Estelle's only two clients, we would like to say  a few words   Dude, where is my speech?
Thank you all for comming  We are here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent   and a beautiful woman   inside..  As Estelle's only two clients, we would like to say  a few words   Dude, where is my speech?
Oh, no.
So did you get the annulment?
I couldn't.
I knew it.
Because you love Rachel.
It's not that.
Annulments are more complicated..
Complicated because of the love.
I do not love Rachel.
I'm telling her about the whole thing... so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible.
Would I do that if I loved her?
I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
I do not have feelings for Rachel, okay?
Oh, what's wrong?
Monica and Chandler are moving in here... and I have to move out and everything is changing.
Oh, my God, come here, come here.
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Thank you.
Of course.
So Ross and Rachel got married.
Monica and Chandler almost got married.
You think we should hook up?
Oh, we do.
But not just yet.
Really?
Well, when?
Well, first Chandler and Monica will get married... and be filthy rich, by the way.
But it won't work out.
I know.
Then I'll marry Chandler for the money.
And you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
Great.
But then we ditch them and we get married.
We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids.
Getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.
What about Ross?
I don't want to go into the whole thing.
But we have words and I kill him
I'm glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Oh, boy.
Me too.
I was thinking, say we had a big fight, and broke up for a few hours.
Technically, we could have sex again.
What do you think, bossy and domineering?
The wedding's off, sloppy and immature.
That's me.
Come on.
Wait.
Cassie's in the guest room.
We're going to lunch.
Get rid of her, obsessive and shrill!
Shrill?
The wedding is back on.
I thought I heard voices.
You must be Chandler.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.
So, ready to go?
Yeah.
Chandler?
I'll be right with you.
It's been so long!
Last time I saw you... ...you were setting up your tent in line for Return of the Jedi.
That's right.
So you did see me that day.
Because it seemed like you didn't.
Yeah, sorry about that.
It's okay.
Come on in.
Thanks for letting me stay here.
Monica's place was nice.
But her fianc?sure stares a lot.
Oh, my God!
You do a great Chandler!
I have a knack for impressions.
Maybe after we get reacquainted you could do me.
Yeah.
No!
How you doing on that... ...hot dog?
She's your cousin.
She's your cousin.
If she knew what was going on in your head, she'd think you were sick.
Or would she?
Let's back up for a second.
She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine.
She was the one who turned down the lights.
She was the one that wanted to rent Logan's Run... ...the sexiest movie ever.
I know that look.
Forget it.
I want it.
She wants it.
I'm going in.
What the hell are you doing?
Say something clever.
Okay, doesn't have to be clever.
Just has to be words.
Say some words.
Any words will do.
Oh, my God, this is the longest... ...that anyone has not talked ever!
There is nothing you could say to make this worse... ...so just say something!
I haven't had sex in a very long time.
Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything.
Phoebe?
Cassie, are you finding everything okay?
Yeah.
Thanks for letting me stay here.
Oh, it's no problem.
What?
Say something.
Say anything.
Ask her out!
She's not your cousin
How are you?
No, I understand.
Come on.
No, I'm fine.
Don't be silly.
But, you know, if anything else opens up, please.
Sorry, Rach.
You know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.
Where were we?
Five card draw.
Jacks are better.
Nothing wild, everybody ante.
Look, Rach, we don't have to do this.
Yes, we do.
All right.
Check.
Check.
I'm in for 50 cents.
Call.
I'm in.
I see your 50 cents and I raise you $5.
I thought it was a 50cent limit.
I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet $5.
Does anybody have a problem with that?
Not at all.
No, no.
Loser?
No, I fold.
What do you mean, you "fold"?
What is this?
I thought that, "Once the cards are dealt, I'm not a nice guy! "
Were you just full of it?
I'm in.
How many do you want?
One.
Dealer takes two.
What do you bet?
I bet $2.
See your 2 and I raise you 20.
I see your 20, raise you 25.
See your 25 and, Monica, get my purse.
There's nothing in it.
Okay, then get me your purse.
Here you go.
Good luck!
Thank you.
I saw your 25 and I raise you seven.
Teen!
Joey, I'm a little shy.
That's okay, Ross.
You can ask me.
What do you need?
Fifteen.
Here's 1 0.
I got 5.
Thank you.
Good luck.
I am calling your 1 7.
What do you got?
Full house!
You got me.
That's a tough hand to beat.
I thought we had them!
When you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards.
But look how happy she is.
Airport '79!
Time's up.
God, I love these fingers.
Thank you.
No, actually, I meant my fingers.
Look at them.
Look at how happy they are.
Oh, my God, I'm late!
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't go, don't go.
Okay, okay.
I have to.
Look, she's leaving.
I'm sorry.
He'll be waiting for me.
I thought you talked to Rick.
It's not Rick.
Ethan?
He gets the whole day with you!
No, it's Andrew.
I know there'll be many moments when I'll regret asking the following question, but.
And Andrew is?
He's new.
So you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
No, that's not exactly what I was.
Most women would kill for three guys like us.
So what do you want?
You.
You have me.
No, no.
Just you.
What do you mean?
Lose the other guys.
Like, all of them?
Come on, we're great together.
Why not?
Why can't we just have what we have now?
Why can't we just talk, laugh and make love without feeling obligated to one another?
Up until tonight, I thought that's what you wanted too.
Well, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys.
I mean, one guy's saying, "Shut up!
This is great! "
But there's this other guy.
It's the guy who wells up every time the Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device.
He's saying, you know, "This is too hard.
Get out, get out! "
So which one of the two guys will you listen to?
I have to listen to both.
They don't let each other finish.
Which one?
The second guy.
I see.
Call me if you change your mind.
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
Look at it this way.
You dumped her!
Right?
I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable.
Tell me why you did this again?
Movie star!
Here you go, kids.
And then the peacock bit me.
Please kiss me at midnight!
You seen Sandy?
I don't know how to tell you this but she's in the bedroom getting it on with Max, that scientist geek.
Cool, look at that.
I did know how to tell you.
Hey, everybody, the ball is going.
What?
The ball is dropping!
In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.
And the moment of joy is upon us.
Looks like that "NoDate Pact" thing worked out.
Everybody looks so happy.
I hate that!
Not everybody is happy.
Hey, Bobby!
Four, three, two, one!
Happy New Year!
I just thought I'd throw this out.
I'm no math whiz but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.
I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
I can't kiss anyone.
So I'm kissing everyone?
You can't kiss Ross.
That's your brother.
Perfect.
So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Somebody kiss me.
Somebody kiss me!
It's midnight!
Somebody kiss me!
It's midnight!
All right!
All right!
All right!
There!
I wanted this to work so much.
I'm still in there, you know?
Changing his diapers.
Picking his fleas.
But he's just phoning it in.
It's hard to accept that something you love so much doesn't love you back, you know?
I think that bitch cracked my tooth
I just came over to drop off... ...nothing.
So that weekend kind of sucked.
Yeah, it did.
So I guess this is over?
You know, you and me.
I mean, it had to end sometime.
Why exactly?
Because of the weekend.
We had a fight.
Chandler, that's crazy.
If you always gave up after a fight... ...you'd never be with anyone longer than This isn't over?
You are so cute!
No, no.
It was a fight.
You deal with it and you move on.
It's nothing to freak out about.
Really?
Okay, great!
Welcome to an adult relationship.
We're in a relationship?
I'm afraid so.
I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
Saw him waiting for an elevator.
Can I use your eyelash curler?
I lost mine.
It's in the bathroom.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yes.
You?
And you?
But you cannot tell anyone.
No one knows.
But how?
When?
It happened in London.
In London!
We didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
But it is a big deal!
I have to tell someone!
You can't.
Please.
We just don't want to deal with telling everyone.
Please just promise you won't tell.
All right.
Man, this is unbelievable!
I mean, it's great!
But...
I know.
It's great!
I don't want to see that!
We're so stupid.
Do you know what's going on in there?
They're trying to take Joey!
"The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe.
If you win, slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, 'Hi, Phoebe!'"
That's cute.
We really all enjoyed it.
But it doesn't count.
For what?
Just count in our heads as good Mad Libs.
I gotta go.
Fun's over.
Wait, if we follow the rules... ...it's still fun and it means something.
I'm going to take off.
Guys, rules are good!
Rules help control the fun
What kind of research?
Just, you know, science.
Science.
Yeah, I think I've heard of that.
It's a fertility study.
Please tell me you're only donating your time.
Come on, you guys.
It's not that big a deal.
I just go down there every other day and make my contribution to the project.
But at the end of two weeks, I get $ 700!
You're gonna be making money hand over fist.
The One Where Rachel Finds Out Okay, we got the coleslaw.
We got the buns.
We've got the groundup flesh of formally cute cows and turkeys.
Men are here!
We make fire.
Cook meat.
Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back!
Cute, cute!
Joey, Melanie called.
She's gonna be late.
So how are things going?
Is she becoming your special someone?
I don't know.
She's pretty great.
What does she think of your Little science project?
You think I'd tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
The man's got a point.
The tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
Crazy bitch!
I got a week left in the program, and according to the rules to get the money, I can't conduct any personal experiments if you know what I mean.
Joey, we always know what you mean.
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!
I think I blacked out there for a minute.
It was nothing.
Well, now we gotta find something fun for you!
You know what?
Forget about me.
Let's give you another turn.
Me, again?
Sure.
Why not?
Boy!
Somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow!
I gotta tell you, you are nothing Like I thought you would be.
How do you mean?
I just had you pegged as one of those guys who are always, "Me, me, me! "
But you, you're a giver.
You're, Like, the most generous man I ever met.
I mean, you're practically a woman.
Hey, big.
Spender!
She's still asleep.
So how'd it go?
It was amazing!
You know how you think you're great in bed?
The fact you'd even ask shows how Little you know me.
Well, Last night I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great.
So I had to do all this other stuff.
And the response I got!
Man, oh, man!
It was Like a tickertape parade!
I know.
My room's very close to the parade route.
It was amazing, and not just for her.
For me too!
It's Like, all of a sudden I'm blind but all my other senses are heightened.
You know?
It's Like, I was able to appreciate it on another level.
I didn't know you had another Level.
I know.
Neither did I!
AII right, you did it!
Do we have any fruit?
Man!
A hell of a two weeks.
You know what, though?
I really feel I learned something.
So you'll stick with this "it's all for her" thing?
What, are you crazy?
When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around Like this?
Okay, how would you like some TikiDeath punch?
What's that?
Well, it's rum and.
Okay.
We thought since Phoebe's staying over we'd have a slumber party.
We're on that TV thing.
Excuse me?
It says to call if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar.
Well, I'm not completely satisfied.
It's kind of an emergency.
You know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.
Hold on.
Fill these out.
Sit over there!
I don't wanna make any trouble.
But I'm in a lot of pain here, all right?
My face is dented.
You'll have to wait your turn.
How long will it be?
Excuse me?
We've been here for over an hour, and people less sick have gone in.
That guy with the toe thing?
Who's he sleeping with?
Oh, come on, Dora.
Don't be mad.
I know we both said some things we didn't mean.
But that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.
You know, I feel like I've lost her.
I remember the moonlight came in through the open window, and her face had the most incredible glow.
Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling.
You did this part.
Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
He's right, enough already.
What is the big deal about today?
So you slept with her for the first time.
So what?
You slept with her for seven years after that.
It's a little more complicated than that.
Is it that she left you?
That she left you for a woman that likes women?
Louder.
There's a man on the 1 2th floor in a coma who didn't hear you.
Then what?
My first time with Carol was, was my.
What?
It was my first time.
With Carol?
So in your whole life, you've only been with one?
Oh, boy.
Hockey was a big mistake.
There's a lot of stuff we could've done tonight.
Man, can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
I think it's great.
You know, it's sweet.
It's romantic.
Really?
No, you kidding?
The guy's a freak.
I judge him.
Hey, buddy!
That's attractive.
I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs.
Admit it, all things considered, you had fun tonight.
Where was the fun?
Tell me specifically which part was the fun part?
Where's my puck?
The kid has it.
The kid?
Excuse me, that's my puck.
I found it.
Finders keepers, losers weepers.
You gotta do it, man.
Oh, yeah?
I'm rubber, you're glue.
Whatever you.
I can't do it.
Listen, give me back my puck.
Yes, how about it.
Come here.
Give me my puck.
No roughhousing in my ER!
Give me my puck!
Now that was fun.
I have a weird feeling about this place.
How do I know..   they won't secretly videotape me and put it all over the lnternet?
Because, honey, and I mean this in the sweetest way possible..   nobody's gonna wanna watch that.
Mr. Bing?
Here you are.
Go into that room and deposit your specimen into the container.
Deposit my specimen?
I usually have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk.
Thanks.
Got it.
All right.
Honey, my tests are down the hall.
Are you sure you're gonna be okay?
Yeah, I guess.
Look, I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares.
No one here even knows you.
Oh, my God!
Oh, come on!
How great is this?
We're probably fertile.
Let's go home.
Why are you here?
Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time..   No, no, no.
I mean, why?
Why is she here?
Oh, someone's a little cranky today because they have to do it in a cup.
Oh, they gave you the kiddie size.
What?
This was fun.
But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to.
I'd love to stay but I've got a hot date.
Please go.
Just let me know if you need a hand.
I think it just fell off.
It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
Hello?
Oh.
Hi, Dr. Connelly.
No.
Well, she's not here..   but I can tell her.
Should I be sitting down for this?
Well, so, what does that mean?
Okay.
Okay, thank you.
Thanks.
Hey, sweetie.
Dr. Connelly just called.
With good news?
Of course it's not good news.
You said, "Dr. Connelly just called."
If it was good, you'd have said, "Dr. Connelly just called!"
So, what is it?
Is it..?
Is there a problem?
Is there a problem with me, or with you?
Actually, it's both of us.
What?
Apparently, my sperm have low motility..   and you have an inhospitable environment.
Well, what does that mean?
It means that my guys won't get off their Barcaloungers..   and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do.
It means..
Wait, Chandler.
It means that we can keep trying..   but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
Well..   we're gonna figure this out.
She came back?
Well, look at you.
Yeah.
What do you think?
Well, it looks great.
It's just..
I'm wearing the same thing underneath, so..   You see what I mean?
Hey!
How come your door's locked?
Just a second!
No, no, no!
Joey can't know I'm here.
Why not?
I didn't want to say I couldn't go to the game..    so I told him I had to stay in Tulsa.
So you lied to him?
It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.
Except with you.
Hey, open the door!
What's going on?
What are you..?
Hi.
Why are you dressed like that?
Because Chandler's gonna be home in a couple of days..   so I thought I would just, you know, practice the art of seduction.
I thought I heard a man's voice before.
No, I was just doing Chandler's side of the conversation.
You know, like, "Hi, how do I look?"
"Really sexy.
Could I be any more turned on?"
You know?
Okay.
Wait a minute.
Why are there two glasses of wine out?
Because one of them is for you!
Cheers!
Okay, byebye.
You know, it's funny.
I've been practicing the art of seduction myself.
You might wanna keep practicing.
Yeah.
It's Joey.
What?
Hey, Joe.
Dude, come home!
What?
Why?
Come home!
Look, I can't.
What's going on?
I don't know how to tell you this, but I think Monica's cheating on you!
I told you, you shouldn't have married someone hotter than you!
If you can't deal with this, then I'm gonna.
No!
I just heard him!
Can you hear him now?
No.
All right, I'm going in.
No, wait!
I heard him again!
All right, just stay there.
I'm coming home.
I'll see you when you get here.
I'll wait out in the hall in case he comes out.
Is that really necessary?
Absolutely.
You'd do it for me.
Not that you ever have to, because I know how to keep my women satisfied.
That didn't take long.
I thought you said Tulsa was, like, a threehour flight?
Well, you're forgetting about the time difference.
That's right!
Your husband's home!
So now the sex can stop!
You know what I mean.
What are you saying?
Joey said you're here with another man!
There's no man in here!
How dare you accuse me of that!
All right.
Then maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a look around.
He can't even see us!
I kind of liked it.
Me too.
What's he doing?
I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.
Bedroom's clear.
Although you might need some new pillows.
All right, well, I'll check the guest room.
Why do I smell men's cologne?
I think that's you.
Oh, yeah.
I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
There's nobody here, Joe.
I guess not.
I can't believe you thought I was cheating.
You owe me an apology.
You're right.
I'm so sorry.
It's an honest mistake.
It could happen to anybody.
See you.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
If you just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?
I climbed down the fire escape, and you can't put that in the closet?
So, with the exception of the fermentation process..   beer and ale are basically the same thing.
Hi, yes, I'm sorry.
The models are down the hall.
I'm here about the assistant job.
Really?
Okay, well, then, all right.
Well, just have a seat there.
So, what's your name?
Tag Jones.
Go on.
That's it.
That's my whole name.
That's your whole name.
Of course it is.
Okay, let's just have a looksee here.
I haven't worked in an office before.
I don't have much experience... What are you talking about?
You got three years painting houses... ...two whole summers at TGI Friday's.
It's lame, I know.
But I'm a goaloriented person, eager to learn... Just hold on a second, please.
It's for human resources.
Everybody has to.
Hi, Tag.
What are you doing here?
I came to thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday.
I noticed there aren't any plants, so I brought you your first...
There is a plant in your office.
Kind of.
Right.
So I guess I shouldn't put "good at noticing stuff" on my r?um?
Thank you.
Anyway...
...I'm guessing you hired somebody.
Well... Gotcha.
Thanks again for meeting with me.
But I hired you.
What?
Yeah, you got the job.
You're my new assistant.
I am?
Yeah.
I can't believe it.
First, I need you to go downstairs... ...find a woman named Hilda and tell her to go home.
Rachel Green's office.
Tag.
Hi, who was that?
Nobody.
I was just practicing.
Really?
Hi.
Hi, Rachel Green's office.
You must be Hilda.
He's Tag.
This is Phoebe.
Phoebe, can I see you for a sec?
Phoebe.
That's a great name.
Oh, you like that?
You should hear my phone number.
Okay.
We'll be right back.
So you hired yourself a little treat, did you?
I know how it looks, but I am telling you... You can't get involved with your assistant.
I know that, and I know hiring him was not the smartest thing I've ever done.
But from now on, I swear this is strictly professional.
Yes.
Hey, Rachel.
Hi.
Cute assistant.
What's his story?
Is he...
Gay?
Yeah.
What's up?
I got asked out twice today while I was at lunch... ...by guys.
Really?
Yeah.
Did you tell someone that I was gay?
Oh, did you not want people to know that?
I'm not gay.
I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay.
Why is that?
I don't think I should say.
Oh, you can say.
Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.
Okay.
Okay.
Well...  Yeah.
I'd love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
Yeah, she's gay
We should ask the doctorif she even knows..   how to deliver a babythat's half human, half pure evil!
Hi, Dr. Long.
How are you?You're nice to her.
She has the drugs.
We'll do a quick check.
Eight days late, huh?You must be getting uncomfortable.
Yeah, just a tad.
You're 80% effaced.
You're on your way.It still could last a while.
There are ways to help things along.Do them!
Actually, they're thingsthat you can do.
Home remedies.
In my experience, I've foundsome are very effective.
Well, we are ready to try anything.There's an herbal tea you can drink.
You can take some castor oil.There's spicy foods.
We will do all of those.
Taking a long walk.Good.
Done.
And there's the one that'sproved most effective: sex.
You've got to be kidding me!
Finish your enchilada.
Ross, we've tried all the spicy food.It's not working.
Okay, here, have one of these peppers.
Oh, God.
So hot.
Oh, my God.
By the way, you don't want to touchthe pepper and then touch your eye.
I am feeling nothing.
Speaking of hot,watching you do that..   really makes me wantto have sex with you.
Stop it.Come on!
Why are we wasting time?
We know it's gonna work.It's doctorrecommended.
I'm sorry.
But we have to havesome boundaries.
My God, I'm dying.
We've done it before.We'll do it again.
It'll be a nice wayto bookend the pregnancy.
I'm not gonna make love to youso you'll go into labor.
Make love?
What are you, a girl?
Always a great way to getinto a man's pants.
You'll be performing a service.Think of me as a ketchup bottle.
Sometimes, you have to bang onthe end of it to get it to come out.
I love when you talk dirty to me.
I know it.
You're right.That's not sexy.
Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork.
Let me just bend over and get it.
Oh, God!
Okay, enough.This is not going to happen.
Come on, Ross.
I'm miserable here.
Come on, you started this,now you finish it!
Come on, wuss.
Make love to me.
You know what?What?
Forget it.
What now, Ross,you're not gonna talk?
How on earth will you ever annoy me?
Oh, wait a minute, I know.
You'd think the jalapeno wouldclear up your sinuses, but no!
That's not enough..What are you doing?
I'm getting that baby out of you!
Oh, God!I know.
Oh, no, no, no.
I think my water just broke.
I am good!
Okay, I got the pillow.I got the bag.
You got the keys?I got the keys.
We're having a baby.
I didn't have time to read this partof the books, but do we have time..?
Not so much.Okay, let's go.
200.Thank you.
That's it.
I don't care whenthe baby comes.
I can't watch.
It's like firing Elmo.
Sandy?
Hi.
Hi.
We..   We kind of need to talk.
I'm afraid it's not working out.
I mean, Rachel and I think you are great with Emma.
We just feel..  You!
You feel!
I just feel..   that the chemistry isn't right.
I'm sorry.
We're more than happy to give you a good recommendation.
No, that's okay.
I had a lot of offers from other families.
I just picked you guys because..
I liked you the best.
Oh, damn you, Geller!
Anyway, well I'm glad there's no hard feelings.
None at all.
You need to be happy with whoever is in your home.
Although, if you don't mind telling me..   what was the problem?
Maybe it's something I can work on in the future.
No, you know, it's nothing you did.
It's my issue.
What is it?
Please?
You know, I'm just not that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you.
That's fair.
Although, can I ask, why do you think that is?
Why?
I don't know.
Maybe because of my father?
You know, when I was growing up, he was a tough guy.
You know, and as a kid, I wasn't the athlete I am now.
I play squash!
Anyway, I always got the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.
That must have been hard.
It was hard.
I remember I was in my bedroom, playing with my dinosaurs..
Playing and learning.
And my father walks in and says, "What are you doing with those things?
What's wrong with you?
Why aren't you outside playing like a real boy?"
But you are a real boy.
I know I am!
And when it's summer and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?!
It's all right.
Crying is good.
It lets the boohoos out.
And what's the one kind of boat that can never ever sink?
What kind?
A friend ship!
Wow!
You blow my mind!
I gotta go.
How much do I owe you?
Twenty bucks.
It's like the cheapest college ever!
I'll see you tomorrow.
I think you should go out with this guy.
He doesn't do anything for me.
Last Saturday night, what happened on Walker, Texas Ranger?
Well, Walker was looking for this big busload of kids.
All right, I get your point.
All right.
Hi.
Hey.
I forgot the combination to this about a year ago.
I just carry it around.
You got any Chap Stick?
Yeah.
How are those tapes working out?
Good.
I haven't smoked yet today.
I feel great and confident.
That is a stunning blouse.
Thank you.
Here you go.
Thanks.
Okay, Mon.
Let's give Pete a chance.
He was funny.
He seems really nice.
That check thing was adorable.
What check thing?
As a joke, this customer who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip.
His number's on the check.
He did it so I'd call.
Pete Becker.
Pete... Is this him?
That's Bill Clinton.
Who's he hugging?
Oh, my God.
That's Pete.
Why is Bill hugging Pete?
This guy invented Moss 865.
Every office in the world uses that program.
We use it!
There you go!
Monica's gonna go out with a millionaire.
I'm not gonna go out with him.
Why not?
He's a millionaire.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check.
This is so exciting.
Or incredibly offensive.
Yeah, sure.
That too.
Can we make it smaller?
Make it fit on the head of a pin?
I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.
You have a Monica Geller here.
Absolutely.
Yeah, send her in.
Hi.
What the hell is this?
Hang on for a sec.
I'll talk to you in the morning?
You got it.
I'm sorry.
What?
What is this supposed to mean?
Well, you know, I never know how much to tip.
You double the tax.
Not double the tax of Romania.
Are you buying me?
Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
I'm still here.
You're taking this wrong.
If I didn't leave you that tip... ...you wouldn't have come, we wouldn't have this argument... ...and there wouldn't be this heat between us.
You gotta admit that our relationship is hitting a new level now.
You were the chef and I was the customer.
But now we're, like, this couple that fights.
You're a loon.
Look, forget the check, okay?
I like you.
I think you're great.
Come on, what do you say?
I don't know.
Why not?
Because I don't wanna encourage this kind of behavior.
One meal.
That's all I'm asking for.
Please?
We go out, we eat.
If you don't have a good time, I'll give you 10 grand, we're even.
The millionaire's here!
Oh, my God!
I'm just gonna have dinner with him.
Okay, just because he buys you dinner does not mean you owe him anything.
I know.
Okay, then get the lobster.
Hey.
Hi.
Hi.
Hey.
How much cash you got in your pocket now?
And that's why I'm not inviting you in for a drink.
Bye.
Why not?
Hey, come in for a drink.
Where do you wanna go?
You like pizza?
That sounds great.
I know a great little place.
You're not paying for the pizza.
Come on, it's only fair.
You paid for the flight.
Is that enough lira?
I'd throw another 1000 on that.
How much is that?
That's about 60 cents.
Every night!
I'm Ross, I don't believe we met.I'm Monica's older brother.
Hi, I'm Mona from her restaurant.
Hello, Mona from her restaurant.
Mona.
What a beautiful name.
You think so?I always kind of hated it.
Come on!
Mona Lisa.
Mona...   Llegglachen.
The famous botanist.
Oh, no, she's..Well, she's dead now, but..
Supposedly she was oncequite the hottie of the plant world.
Really?
See, I never knew about her.Linda Llegglachen..
So, what table are you at?
Me too.
Good.
Now there'll be someone therewho likes my name.
Yes, there will.
It was the chair again.
Okay?I'm not doing it!
Dad.
Can't you go back to your table?
Apparently little Molly Gilbert isenjoying her grownup salmon en croute.
Look, I don't..You know what?
Would you like to dance?Sure.
Great.
Dr. Geller.I wasn't farting!
A little game from our table.
Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?
Maybe later.
Right now,I'm about to dance with this lady.
Unless this lady wouldn't mindletting you go first.
I'd be happy to.You are very sweet.
Yes, I am.
In fact, let's try my special way.You can dance on my feet.
Sure.Yeah?
Hop on.
Is the pretty lady looking?Keep dancing.
And the world will never know.
Thank you.No, thank you, Miranda.
Melinda.All right.
How cute was that?Oh, were you watching?
Can I go next?
Of course you can.
Hop on.
Okay, but I get to hop on after her.
Thank you.That was very nice, Ashley.
Can we do it again?No, no.
So, is it my turn now?I'm next.
That's okay, you can dance with her first.Are you sure?
So, what's your name?Gert.
That's pretty.
What are you doing there, Gert?
Dancing on your feetlike the other girls did it.
Hop on, Gert.
Why aren't you moving your feet?I'm trying.
Faster.
You're not going fast enough.
I just didn't see the fast song coming.
Don't talk, we'll get you up to your room,soak your feet.
You'll be okay.
Thank you.That is so sweet!
No, I mean it.
There are so fewgenuinely nice guys out there.
Tell me about it.
I feel like I'mholding down the fort by myself.
It's Joey, right?Yeah.
Wait a minute!
No!
I'm the nice one!
I'm the one that dancedwith the kids all night.
I..   How small are your feet?
Unless we give her all gifts she can use after her pregnancy.
Like regular coffee.
Tequila!
You thought it'd make me feel better?
To give me something I can't use for two months?
Hi, guys.
Hi, Phoebe.
I wanted to apologize if I seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower.
Just the hormones.
No, we Hormones.
I wanted to say thank you.
It was so sweet.
You seem to be doing much better.
How are things going?
Good.
Everything's been about me lately.
So what's happening with you?
We were just talking about me not going to Ross' wedding.
It just might be too hard, given the history and all that.
This reminds me of the time when I lived on the street.
This guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
How is this like that?
Well, let's see.
It's not really like that.
Because that was an actual problem.
And yours is just a bunch of highschool crap... ...that nobody really gives!
I'm sorry.
I just thought Here come the water works.
Here's your tea, Phoebe.
It's so good.
Thanks.
Good.
So glad you like it.
What?
She made the tea.
I think I just had a contraction.
What?
My God!
I felt one a few minutes ago.
That definitely was one.
You can't have the baby here.
I haven't sterilized the apartment since the guys moved out!
It's okay.
I'll boil some water and rip up some sheets.
It's probably false labor.
That can happen near the end.
Just get the book.
Get the book!
The book!
I don't get how you know it's false labor.
Do you see any babies?
How do you feel?
Okay, I guess.
I don't know.
I know it's going to be over soon so...
But isn't that a good thing?
You said you were sick of this.
I know.
Usually, when you're done with the pregnant thing... ...you get to do the mom thing.
But I'll be sitting around in my leather pants, drinking tequila.
Some moms do that.
That's even sadder.
Look, I know what I got myself into.
It's just that now that they're in me... ...it's like I know them and...
It just won't be easy when these babies have to go away.
I know, sweetie.
But it's not like you won't have anything.
You'll have nieces and nephews.
That's even better.
Yeah, okay.
No, really.
You won't be the one worrying about saving for college.
Or yelling at them when they're bad.
Or putting them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down.
You'll be the one they run away to.
The one they talk to about sex.
You just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe.
Cool Aunt Phoebe.
I am pretty cool.
And you know what else?
Are they going to love you!
They are going to love me.
Thanks, you guys.
Again.
Oh, sweetie.
Thanks.
What?
Just kidding.
Oh, my God!
Got you again.
You're so easy!
I'm telling U.
She went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross.
Oh, my God!
This is huge!
This is bigger than huge.
This is... All right, what's bigger than huge?
This?
Guys, you got new haircuts!
Yes, we did.
Thanks to Vidal Buffay.
Because, you know, "If you don't look good, we don't look good."
I love that voice!
Ross.
Not alone.
Julie.
Arm around her!
Cramp!
Cramp!
Cramp!
I think she's trying to tell us something.
Quick, get the verbs.
You!
You!
You said he liked me!
You!
You slowpokes!
That's all right.
We got the bags.
This is my sister, Monica.
This is Chandler.
Phoebe, hi.
Joey.
Everyone, this is Julie.
Julie.
But I'm not here, you haven't met me.
I'll make a better impression when I don't have 20 hours of plane on me.
And bus.
Oh, my God!
With the screaming guy  And the spitting.
You gotta hear this story.
We're on this bus that's 200 years old.
Two hundred, at least.
And the chicken poops in her lap!
I'm so sorry.
I just gave away the ending, didn't I?
I just heard this story in the cab... ...and it is all I can think about.
This is amazing.
How did this happen?
We were in grad school together.
We haven't seen each other since then.
I land in China... ...guess who's in charge of the dig?
Julie!
Isn't that great?
Isn't that just kickyouinthecrotch, spitonyourneck fantastic?
It's an expression.
We just wanted to say a quick hi.
Then we'll see the baby.
Then get some sleep.
It's 6:00 tomorrow night, our time.
Don't tell us what's gonna happen.
I like being surprised.
Bye!
Can I get some coffee?
Sure.
Did you talk to him yet?
No.
Then, no.
What the hell happened to you in China?
When last we left you, you were in love with, you know.
I know I was.
But there was always this voice inside that kept saying: "It's never gonna happen.
Move on."
You know whose voice that was?
God?
It was you, pal.
Maybe it was God doing me.
You were right.
She looks at me and sees a friend.
That's all.
And then I met Julie... ...and we're having a great time.
I never would have gone for it, if it hadn't been for you.
Well, you owe me one, big guy.
Your lemonade.
I didn't order it.
Then go take that back.
They'll charge you for that.
Go, go, go!
Come on, come on!
So what did you find out?
He said...
They're having a great time.
I'm sorry.
But the silver lining, if you wanna see it... ...is that he made this decision all by himself... ...without any outside help whatsoever.
How is that a silver lining?
You have to really wanna see it.
Hey, Rach.
Somebody got you shoes.
Give me!
Wow.
Wow.
Oh, my God!
Careful!
Careful!
These are my rat babies!
Yeah.
We have rat babies now.
You brought rats to my birthday party?
So this is what a stroke feels like.
Well, I had to bring them.
We killed their mother.
They're our responsibility now.
You know, they require constant care.
You should know that, you're a mother.
Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
No.
Seven rats.
We should take them home.
We need to feed them.
You're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?
Well, I'm sorry, Rachel, but I'm not like you.
Okay?
Not everyone can afford help.
Hey, where the hell are Joey and Molly?
Okay, you start preparing the formula..   and I'll start changing the box.
And then we gotta put them straight to bed.
When did we become one of those couples..   whose lives revolve around their rats?
Well, you know what?
They're our responsibility now.
Okay, fine.
These rats are our responsibility.
What happens when they mate and there are hundreds?
Mate?
They're all brothers and sisters.
Yeah, not such a problem with rats.
No, they're more of a "love the one you're with" kind of animal.
No.
Really?
Oh, my.. Get off your sister!
Oh, my God.
What are we gonna do?
The.. We have seven rats.
So, what if each of them has seven rats..   and then each of those has seven rats?
That's like..   That's math I can't even do!
What are we gonna do?
Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy..   but we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives.
Yeah, okay.
I guess you're right.
All right, so we should just give them away.
But to nice families with children and reducedfat Wheat Thins.
Those were Bob's favorites.
It's gonna be okay.
You must think I'm crazy.
No, I think you're sweet.
Good.
This is just so hard.
It's hard for me to let them go.
I guess it just brings back memories, you know..   from when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up.
I haven't told you about that yet, have I?
I really mean it.
It's beautiful.
If you don't mind..?
Let me.
Well, what do you know, it fits.
See, Gavin.
You're capable of being a nice guy.
Why do you give me such a hard time?
I'm not sure.
Well, Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
I do have feelings for you.
You do?
Yes.
I feel that you're a little annoying.
See, why?
Gavin, why?
Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you..   And you do that.
Hey.
Listen, I think I left something here.
Well, somebody left this.
Is this yours?
No, but I like it.
No, I think I left one of my rat babies.
Well, no.
I haven't seen it, but if I do, I'll let you know.
Rat baby!
Rat baby!
Rat baby!
Rat baby!
Maybe that's him

I've been waiting for you.
Hi, I just Oh, my God!
Monica!
Oh, my God!
I'm sorry!
I was I was taking a nap.
Since when do you take naps in that position?
Tell me you were waiting for a guy.
Please tell me.
Yes, I was.
A guy.
From work.
I'm seeing a guy from work!
That cute waiter guy that looks like a nonthreatening Ray Liotta?
That one!
Give me a second.
I'm just going to grab a jacket.
When I get back, I want every little detail.
Maybe that's him.
It's just Joey and Ross.
Why aren't you at the movie?
Ross was so loud, they threw us out.
I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
He's talking to London.
Did he get in touch with Emily?
No, not yet.
He's hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
I don't care if I said some other girl's name, you prissy old twit!
Way to suck up to the family!
I'm so glad you're all here.
My office finally got wrinklefree fax paper!
The One Where Phoebe Hates PBS Hi, is this Nanny Hopkins?
Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
Yeah, she might have mentioned him.
So, Mon, when are we going to meet this new, secret waiter man?
I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Yeah, I don't think he's up to it.
I want to meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had.
Really?
That's what you heard?
You said that?
I might have.
Why is that funny?
Because I'm very happy for him.
...I got carried away before, but there's something you got to know.
If I'm the best, it's only because you made me the best.
Keep talking.
I was nothing before you.
Call the other girls and ask.
Which wouldn't take long.
But when I'm with you, and we're together... ...oh, my God!
Really?
Oh, my God!
I understand if you never want to sleep with me again.
But that would be wrong.
We're too good.
We owe it to sex!
If we owe it!
Oh, my!
When will Joey be home?
I was kind of hoping we could do this without him.
No, no, no!
Leave the gloves on.
I cleaned the bathroom.
Why don't we lose the gloves.
All right.
Let's show them how it's done.
You know that wasn't part of it?
I know.
Never done that before.
Nope
Okay, now I really have to go.
It's so unfair that our date has to get cut short... ...just because some guy shot at a store clerk.
I know, but it's my job.
Then maybe I could come too.
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.
All right, you go.
Oh, God!
What?
Oh, I just miss him so much!
For just a week, you guys are close.
Yeah, it's weird.
I can't help it.
He's so sweet.
He's like this little puppy dog, you know?
But like a really tough one who shoots bad guys.
I love the beginning parts of relationships.
You can't keep your hands off each other.
I know.
It is the best.
How long did that last for you and Chandler?
What?
It's still going on.
Come on, seriously.
When did it end?
I am serious.
We're all over each other all the time.
Okay, you know where you are better than I do.
Why don't you just calm down?
Get all your facts before you tell everybody you're the only hot couple.
God, I woke the beast.
I was wrong, obviously.
I just misspoke.
It's okay.
It is okay.
As long as you know Chandler and I are also hot and fiery.
Just as hot as you.
I mean, our flame...
It is on fire!
Here's your broom back.
You are so cute!
The cute bar keeps getting lower and lower, doesn't it?
What do you say, maybe, sometime I hold your gun?
We're not supposed to do that.
What could happen?
I mean Yeah.
I'm gonna say no.
Do you want to see a movie tonight?
We can't.
We already have plans.
What are you doing?
Well, same thing we did all day.
Just hang out at Gary's apartment.
He is so amazing.
We never left the bedroom.
But have fun at the movie.
Well, we're not seeing a movie.
Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
Because I just wanted to know what you were doing... ...so you wouldn't walk in on me and Chandler... ...while we were doing it all night.
Will you excuse me?
Chandler?
Can I see you for a second?
We have got to beat them!
Why?
Because Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than us.
So?
So we've gotta go have a lot of sex and prove them wrong!
You've got to stop this competitive thing.
It's crazy.
Just to impress them, you want us to have sex over and over... ...and I'm saying no to this, why?
Get your coat!
Excuse me.
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
That was amazing.
We are the hottest, huh?
No one is hotter than we are.
We're the best.
No, you're the best.
No, you're the best.
No, you're the best.
I am the best.
Hey, guys.
What you been doing?
Is Rachel here?
No, she's out shopping.
Damn!
What's going on?
I told Emily to come.
And I just need to, you know, talk to Rachel about it.
Wait a minute.
When Emily comes, you won't see Rachel anymore?
I'm focusing on the "I get to see my wife" part... ...and not on the part that makes me do this.
So you'll never be in a room together?
How will that even work?
I have no idea.
I mean...
But I assure you, I will figure it out.
It doesn't seem like it'll work.
Hi, guys.
What's going on?
We're flipping Monica's mattress.
So I'm thinking, basically, we pick it up and then we flip it.
That's better than my way.
Hey guys, would you flip mine too?
Oh, man.
Oh, look!
A letter from my mom.
So, Rach?
You know how Emily's coming?
Oh, yeah.
I know.
Can you hear anything?
Yeah, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
Hey, Joey's ass.
What are you doing?
Remember when they fought and broke up... ...and we were stuck here all night with no food?
When Ross said "Rachel" at the wedding, I figured it'd happen again.
So I hid this in here.
Candy bars, crossword puzzles... Mad Libs!
Mine!
Okay, "Name of someone in room."
Magazines, Doritos Condoms?
You don't know how long we'll be in here.
We may have to repopulate the Earth.
And condoms are the way to do that?
Anyway, it all boils down to this.
The last time I talked to Emily Oh, my God!
Our dog died!
What?
Oh, my God!
LaPooh, our dog!
LaPooh's still alive?
Sorry.
It says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for... ...nineteen blocks!
Oh, my God.
Sweetie, we heard you crying.
Please don't cry.
It's LaPooh!
I know, it's LaPooh right now but it'll get better.
You know how there was something I wanted to talk to you about?
Oh, yeah.
I'm trying to work things out with Emily.
Well, there's this... ...one thing.
Here goes.
I made a promise that What?
Your nose is bleeding.
Oh, God!
We really all enjoyed it.
Trouble?
Your sister stood me up the other night.
Oh, no.
Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
Did you try calling her?
I've been trying for two days.
When I called the restaurant, they said she was busy.
I can't believe she's blowing me off!
You got a minute?
Yeah, I'm just working.
I got you a birthday present.
Wow, you remembered!
It's a Judy Jetson thermos.
Like the kind you.
Right.
Oh, I got something for you too.
How'd you know I was coming?
Yeah, twin thing.
I can't believe you did this.
I can't believe you did this!
So what's the deal with you and Joey?
Oh, right.
He is so great.
But that's over.
Does he know?
Who?
Joey.
You know, he's really nutsy about you.
He is?
Why?
You got me.
Excuse me, doesn't this come with a side salad?
So are you gonna call him?
You think he likes me?
No.
Joey.
No, no.
He is so smart.
He'll figure it out.
Do you want some chicken?
No, no.
No food with a face, remember?
You have not changed.
Yeah, you too.
Hi!
Remember us?
You just called about needing a signature on the admissions form?
Urs!
I've been trying to call you.
Listen.
Don't say "listen. "
I know that "listen. "
I've said that "listen. "
I'm sorry.
I don't get it.
What happened?
What about what you said under the bridge?
Forget about what I said under the bridge.
I was talking crazy that night.
I was so drunk.
You don't drink.
That's right, I don't.
But I was drunk on you.
But it's not gonna work.
Why?
Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
No, I couldn't do that.
Then, yeah, it's because of Phoebe.
So you know, it's either her or me.
Then I'm sorry.
You're gonna be really hard to get over.
I know.
I don't know whether it's just because we're breaking up or what but you've never looked so beautiful.
Really?
Pheebs?
He looks so tiny.
You're doing great.
What's going on?
Monica's a little drunk.
Yeah!
I love drunk Monica.
Oh, she's so much more fun than regular Monica.
She doesn't want her parents to know.
All right, all right.
Here's what we'll do.
I'll get twice as drunk, then no one will even notice her.
Drunk Phoebe's mean.
Okay, you watch your tone with me!
What's going on?
Monica's wasted.
Maybe that will liven up this party.
Will you just help her get changed?
Taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
This one's from me.
It wasn't on your list, but it's really fun.
I'm telling you, it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
You're drunk.
Mom and Dad are gonna be mad.
Maybe I'm a little drunk.
Are those crab cakes?
Did I not tell you to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
How you feeling?
You are so handsome.
I want to make love to you right here, right now.
I really wish that you wouldn't.
Just get through a little bit more, then we can put you in bed.
Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
Speech, speech!
Let's hear from the birthday girl.
Pheebs!
See, everybody's looking at me.
The plan's working.
I didn't even have to take off my top yet.
Speech.
Come on, speech!
You can't keep your hands off her for one second.
I think it's nice.
I think it's necessary.
I want to thank you all for coming.
My family and... ...my friends.
I'd really like to say that I'm... You know what I'd really like to say?
I'm drunk!
Okay, quick.
Help me get this off.
I lost a whole year.
I can't believe it.
This is so unfair!
Come on, Pheebs, it'll be okay.
Will it?
Will it?
How would you feel if you found out you were 31?
That's not gonna happen.
Because we have a new deal.
Plus, it ruined my schedule.
I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31.
Like what?
Like I haven't met any Portuguese people.
I haven't had the perfect kiss.
And I haven't been to sniper school.
Why don't we go and have some birthday cake.
I just feel like being by myself for a while.
See you guys later.
Thanks.
Poor Pheebs.
Hey, you know what, you guys?
I think I'm gonna walk her home.
Oh, man.
What?
He's gonna eat the cake.
Pheebs!
Listen, I... Close your eyes.
That's one thing you can cross off your list.
Oh, yeah.
Plus, I'm onesixteenth Portuguese.
Okay, is everybody clear?
I guess we know who I'll take to the awards!
Don't kid about that!
Will all the stars be there?
Many are scheduled to appear.
I can't go.
I'll be too nervous!
I'll go.
You're getting married.
This is all I have.
"The winner is... Joey Tribbiani!"
"I honestly never expected this.
I didn't prepare a speech.
I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me.
Also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel..." I'm fourth?
Jeez!
Look at you with your maple syrup award!
Maybe you don't tell anyone about this?
No big deal.
I do that with my shampoo bottle.
Really?
Yeah.
What award are you practicing for?
Grammy.
For Best New Artist.
The Soapies people called today.
I also get to present an award.
So you'll get on stage even if you don't win.
You don't think I'll win?
Of course I do.
But Favorite Returning Character?
That's a tough category.
You're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
No, I know I might not win.
But it's just...
I've never been nominated.
I want it so much.
You'll probably get it.
But you should start practicing your "graciousloser" face.
When the cameras are on you, you want to look disappointed.
But also that your colleague deserved to win.
Like: You know?
You practice losing the Grammys too?
We had to get out of there because... Look what I won!
Oh, my God.
You stole her award!
No, no, no.
I'm accepting it on her behalf.
I don't think you know what "behalf" means.
Sure I do.
It's a verb.
As in "I be halfin' it"!
You've got to take this back.
I should've won.
I really wanted it.
She didn't care enough to come to the thing.
It could also be a Grammy.
No, Joey.
No one saw me take it.
There's a whole table of them.
Do you want an award you didn't win?
No, I want an award I did win.
But nobody's given me any of those!
If I put it up, when people come over, they'll see it... ...and think I won it.
Joey, it says "Best Supporting Actress."
I can scratch that right off.
This is wrong.
You have to take it back.
You don't want to win an award this way.
You're very talented.
Someday you'll win one of these for real and that one will mean something.
Oh, all right.
All right?
Thank you.
I'll take it back tomorrow.
Thank you.
If I can't have it, you can't have it!
I'll be out in a second.
"It's just so unexpected!
I'll tell you, it's such an honor to just be nominated... ...for a Nobel Prize.
And, you know, to win one for a massage!
Especially just after winning a Tony Award for Best Actress..." Our reservations are at 8.
"...in Reservations at Eight by Neil Simon.
Thank you, Neil.
Thank you for the words."
Finish this later.
We're gonna be late.
Please don't play the music.
Just one more thing.
When you have a second, I want to show you why we don't just trap spiders... ...under coffee mugs and leave them there.
I'm training to be better at a job that I hate.
My life officially sucks.
Wasn't this supposed to be a temporary thing?
I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff.
Well, yeah.
I'm still pursuing that.
How, exactly, are you pursuing that?
You know, other than sending out resumes, like, what?
Two years ago?
Well, I'm also sending out... ...good thoughts.
If you ask me, as long as you got this job... ...you got nothing pushing you to get another one.
You need The Fear.
The Fear?
He's right.
If you quit this job, you then... ...have motivation to go after a job you really want.
Why are you still at a job you hate?
I mean, why don't you quit and get The Fear?
Because I'm too afraid.
I don't know.
I mean, I would give anything to work for a designer, you know, or a buyer.
I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.
Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28 and still working here.
Rachel?
Yeah?
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.
Can't I just look at the handles on them?
You would think.
Okay, fine.
Gunther, you know what?
I am a terrible waitress.
Do you know why I'm a terrible waitress?
Because I don't care.
I don't care.
I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf.
I don't care where the tray spot is.
I just don't care.
This is not what I want to do.
So I don't think I should do it anymore.
I'm gonna give you my week's notice.
What?
Gunther, I quit.
Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?
Hey, how'd the interview go?
I blew it.
I wouldn't have even hired me.
Come here, sweetie.
Listen... ...you're gonna go on, like, a thousand interviews before you get a job.
That's not how that was supposed to come out.
This is just the worst Christmas ever.
You know what, Rach?
Maybe you should stay here at the coffeehouse.
I can't.
It's too late.
Terry already hired that girl over there.
Look at her.
She's even got waitress experience.
Last night she was... ...teaching everybody how to make... ...napkins... ...into... That word was "swans."
Well, seeing that drunk Santa wet himself really perked up my Christmas.
Oh, God, you're the best!
It's like Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.
Hello.
Yeah, this is she.
You're kidding.
You're kidding.
Thank you.
I love you!
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
I got the job!
That's great.
God bless us, everyone.
Here we go.
Serving my last cup of coffee.
There you go.
Enjoy.
Should I tell her I ordered tea?
No.
Excuse me, everyone.
This is my last night working here... ...and I just wanted to say... ...that I made some really good friends here.
And it's just time to move on.
And no offense to everybody who still works here... ...but you have no idea how good it feels to say... ...that as of this moment...
...I will never have to make coffee again.
Now, Mr. Kaplan Sr.
Likes his coffee strong.
So you're gonna use two bags instead of one.
See.
Now, pay attention, because this part's tricky.
See, some people use filters just once...
I'm sorry you didn't get to go to Space Camp... ...and I'm hoping that maybe somehow this may help make up for it.
Well, I won't be able to come.
For those who haven't checkedtheir calendars, today's my due date.
You should come.Maybe you'll have the baby in the limo.
That way for the first few moments of herlife, she'll think we're really fancy.
I want to thank you guysfor how great you've been during this.
I couldn't have done it without you.I loved these last 9 months.
I'm looking forwardto the next part..
I am really gonna missbeing pregnant.
That's right.
Still no baby.
Is the puffy,sweaty pregnant lady..   disturbing your preciouscoffee time?
Come on, people, make some room.
Sweetie, maybe you'd bemore comfortable here.
You.
Like you haven't done enough.
I know you're miserable.I wish there was something I could do.
I wish I were a sea horse.
Because with sea horses, it's the male.They carry the babies.
And then also,I'd be far away in the sea.
God.
I have never been so uncomfortablein my entire life.
I know.
I remember toward the end..   That's a great story.
Tell it whileyou're getting me some iced tea.
Oh, God, get out!Get out, get out, get out!
Let's.
I have to pee.
If I don't come out, it's because I'vechoked to death on the potpourri stink.
You hold her nose, I'll blow in hermouth and the kid'll just.. out of her.
She's a week late.She's got to have it today.
I don't know.
I thinkit's still gonna be a while.
Care to make it interesting?
I bet you she'll have it tomorrow.You're on.
Okay, how much?One hundred thousand dollars.
How about 50 bucks?I'll call Zurich and move some money.
All right, whose turn is itto help me get up?
No one's here.
Oh, damn it!
And you're still pregnant.
I'm sorry.
I knowhow uncomfortable you are.
You know what?
You look great.Yeah, like 50 bucks.
I have to go pee.
Apparently this babythinks my bladder is a squeeze toy.
Damn it.
Here's your 50 bucks.
That's interesting that you lost.Now, I forget, do you like to lose?
All right, stop it.
Double or nothing she has it tomorrow.Fine.
Until then, General Grant, why don'tyou set up camp.. right there?
Rachel here?
We have an appointment.In the bathroom.
Rach, we gotta go.In a minute!
People ask why we're not together.I just don't know what to tell them.
All right, let's go.
Oh, wait a minute.
Do you want to go change first?
The doctor's staying open late for us,but if you hurry..   No, I'm fine.You don't think that's inappropriate?
What?Good God, man.
Don't anger it.
Ross, it is 100 degrees outside.For the first time in weeks, I am..   Fine.
Whatever you want.You're the mommy.
No!
Don't call me "Mommy."
It's bad enough you callyour own mother that.
I'm actually with her on this one.
Hey, come on, I say more dumb things before 9 a.m... ...than most people say all day.
What?
I can't find anything that I wanna eat.
Everything makes me nauseous.
I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake.
Oh, cake!
No.
Honey, I'm sorry.
What is that smell?
It's coming from the bathroom.
Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
It's me.
It's Phoebe.
Listen, there's something in here I want to eat.
What smells so good?
Is it the shampoo?
It's guava.
No.
Wait.
Is it my bologna sandwich?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I can't believe it.
The baby wants bologna.
The baby wants meat.
I can't eat meat.
Wait!
Maybe it's the pickle!
The One With the Fake Party What are you writing?
Then what are you going to put on top of that?
A little salami.
Oh, yeah.
What goes on top of the salami?
Pastrami.
You're a genius.
Give me a hand with the zipper.
It doesn't matter how much I'm craving it.
You know why I'm never gonna eat meat?
Because it's coldblooded murder.
Okay.
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!
What are you doing?
I can't help it!
I need the meat!
The baby needs the meat.
You know when you're dating someone... ...and you don't want to cheat unless it's with someone really hot?
Totally.
This is the same kind of deal.
If you're gonna do something wrong... ...do it right.
Yeah, but at what cost?
Six more months, three meals a day.
I am going to eat, like, you know, millions of cows.
Mommy cows, daddy cows, baby cows No.
No, I will never eat baby cows.
No veal!
Oh, but veal.
What if I even things out for you, meatwise?
What?
I eat a lot of meat, right?
But suppose, until the baby's born, I laid off it.
No extra animals would die.
You'd be eating my animals.
I can't believe you'd do that for me.
Absolutely.
I could be a vegetarian.
There's no meat in beer, right?
What do you got there?
Pastrami.
You know what goes good with that?
Corned beef.
I was going to say bologna.
But that's better.
How about that smoked turkey?
Okay.
Oh, mama!
When is the baby due?
Six months.
If a cow died of natural causes, I could have one of those, right?
Not if I get there first
People are doing it in front of my book.
I'm sorry?
My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school.
I went to see it.
And there were students making babies right in the paleontology section.
Oh, my God.
Did you get to see anything good?
At your school... ...was there a place on campus where students went to fool around?
Yeah, there was.
In the corner of the library where all the books were that nobody ever read.
Yes, there was.
Great, because people kept showing up.
I think it's like a thing.
Hold on a second.
Fifth floor, against that back wall?
Oh, for crying out loud!
Hi, I'm a professor here.
Do you know the paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?
Well, yes.
Just give me five minutes.
I just have to find someone to cover my shift.
No, no, no.
Can I speak to someone in charge?
How can I help?
Hi, I was wondering, is it possible to increase security... ...in the paleontology section?
I wrote a book that's up there.
And instead of reading it, people are... Well, they're rolling around in front of it.
We are aware of the problem you're referring to.
As far as increasing security, I'm afraid the library's understaffed.
I can't help you.
Well, fine.
If I'm the only person with any appreciation... ...of the sanctity of the written word, then I'll go defend it myself.
Don't you follow me.
How can I help you?
We were just looking around.
Oh, you're fellow scholars.
What exactly were you looking for?
Perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings... ...on the Smilodon californicus?
Get out of here!
Meeting someone?
Or are you just here to brush up... ...on Merriam's views on evolution?
Actually, I find Merriam's views far too progressionist.
I find Merriam's views far too progressionist.
I'm sorry.
Who are you?
I'm a professor here.
Ross Geller.
Ross Geller?
Why do I know that name?
It's a...
Wait.
Did you write this?
Yes.
You're the person who checked out my book?
You know, you look nothing like I would have thought.
You're so young.
Well, I skipped fourth grade.
I am very, very sorry.
I got this section covered.
Yeah, in fact, I've got this baby to shine in people's eye...
Okay, see you later.
I just wanted to show Monica your book
The One With Five Steaks and An Eggplant So what have you been up to?
Oh, you know, the usual.
Teaching aerobics... ...partying way too much.
And in case you wondered... ...those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
Can you hold on?
I have another call.
I love her!
I know.
I'm back.
So are we gonna get together?
Absolutely.
How about tomorrow afternoon?
Do you know Central Perk?
Say, fiveish?
Great.
I'll see you then.
Having a phone has finally paid off.
You can't do this.
I can't get a girl like that with conventional methods.
It doesn't matter.
She wanted to call Bob.
Bob could be who she was meant to be with.
You may be destroying their chance for happiness.
We don't know Bob.
We know me.
We like me.
Please let me be happy.
Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
All right.
Go.
Listen, I have to...
I have to confess something.
Yes?
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
How did you  I don't know.
I just had this weird sense.
But that's me, I'm weird and sensitive.
Tissue?
Thanks.
No, you keep the pack.
I'm all cried out today.
Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
What?
You had sex today?
It sounds even cooler when somebody else says it!
I was awesome.
She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
I know it's been a while, but I took that as a good sign.
Still doing the screening?
I had sex today.
I never have to answer that phone again.
At the sound of the beep, you know what to do.
Hey, Bob.
It's Jade.
I wanted to tell you I was really hurt when you didn't show up yesterday.
And just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.
Bob here.
So you met someone, huh?
Yes, I did.
In fact, I had sex with him two hours ago.
So how was he?
Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you.
I bit my lip to keep from screaming your name.
Well, that makes me feel so good.
It was just so awkward and bumpy.
Maybe he had some kind of new style that you're not familiar with.
You have to get used to it.
Let me get that.
You got 5 bucks?
Here comes the beep.
You know what to do.
Hi, it's me.
Listen, Bob.
I'm probably way out of line here.
It's been three years, and you 're probably seeing someone else now... ...but if we could have one night together, for old time's sake... One hot, steamy, wild night..
It really was.
Come here, sweetheart.
You know I think it's time for you to start using night cream.
What?
Nothing.
Just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Musburger.
Check it out.
GiantsCowboys.
You're watching football at a funeral?
No, it's the pregame.
I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
You're a frightening, frightening man.
Oh, no!
My new Paolo shoes!
I hope they're not ruined.
God, what a great day!
What?
Weatherwise.
I know.
The air, the trees.
Even though Nana's gone, there's something almost life.
Ross, are you okay?
No, I'm fine.
Just having my worst fear realized, but.
I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm.
What?
What is it?
You missed a belt loop.
Okay, it's in spasm.
Here, sweetie.
Here.
I took these when I had my golfing accident.
Thanks, Mom.
Sorry.
Hi, I'm Andrea.
I'm Dorothy's daughter.
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
Look who's up!
How do you feel?
I feel great.
I feel great.
I feel great.
Wow, those pills really worked.
Yeah.
Not the first two, but the second two.
I love you guys.
You guys are the greatest.
I love my sister.
I love Pheebs.
That's so nice.
I love you, man.
And listen, if you wanna be gay, be gay!
It doesn't matter to me.
You were right.
I love you the most.
Well, you know who I love the most?
So you don't think I have a quaIity?
Monica, I'm quitting.
I just helped an 81yearold woman put on a thong, and she didn't even buy it.
I'm quitting.
I'm talking to my boss right now.
Yes, I am.
Yes, I am.
Okay, bye.
Call me when you get this message.
Mr. Waltham?
I really need to talk to you.
In a moment, please.
I'm in the middle of a task.
And you have a customer.
Hi.
Hi, I'm Joshua.
I'm Rachel Greene.
What could I do for you, Joshua?
I need a whole new wardrobe.
My wife Well, my exwife I'm so sorry.
Anyway, she burned all of my clothes.
I got away with this suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
Well, at least that's a great suit.
It wasn't much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt.
I need everything down to underwear.
If you're willing, I'm all yours.
Okay.
You needed to speak to me?
No, no, that wasn't me.
We should get started.
Let me show you my underwear.
The selection of underwear that we carry.
I'm sorry.
It's this way.
This way?
I have the best job in the entire world!
The most adorable guy came over, and I got to dress him up all day!
Rachel has a new doll!
I wish he was a doll.
I'd get a Rachel doll and bump them together... ...and make kissing noises.
He's got the most beautiful name.
I never realized.
Joshua.
Joshua.
Joshua.
Josh.
Hello?
Hi.
What do I smell?
I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out.
Just so frustrating.
Why don't you ask him out?
Totally.
That's such a turnon.
Really?
It doesn't seem desperate?
That's the turnon.
He just got a divorce.
Right?
He's probably really nervous around women.
Maybe you just need to make the first move.
I've never asked a guy out before.
You've never asked a guy out?
No.
Have you?
Thousands of times!
That doesn't make me sound too good, does it?
I don't even know how I would go about it.
What I do is, I look a woman up and down, and I say... ..."Hey.
How you doing?"
Oh, please!
Hey.
"Would you like to go to a basketball game with?"
"It's funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets" "Who likes the Knick?"
What do you think?
Well, as a single woman, who is available...
...I think you look great.
Oh, yeah.
You look great.
This looks great.
So you like it?
I do.
I love it.
In fact, I think I'll wear it home.
Great.
Thank you so much for all your help.
Well, I guess this is it.
Thanks.
Maybe I'll see you in the spring for the bathing suits.
You don't want to do that now?
That's okay.
I'll see you around sometime.
Basketball!
Sorry?
I have two tickets to the Knicks game if you're interested... ...just as a thankyou for this week.
That would be great!
Really?
That would be fantastic!
My nephew is crazy about the Knicks!
This is fantastic.
Thank you so much, Rachel.
Good morning.
I just wanted to come over to say that I'm sorry.
Ah, Can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross and that's cool but...  if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.
Well, what would we be doing?
I'd take you out for a romantic night.
Some champagne, fancy dinner,   feel you up on a carriage ride home...   Feel me up?
In the carriage!
Hey,Charlie.
/ Hi  Hi Hey.
So ...  dreading this?
/ Oh, you bet.
I saw it.
Did you bring a little something for Ross?
Actually, uh, it's some stuff you left at my apartments.
Oh.
oh.
Thanks.
And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.
Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out.
Oh, I thought I heard voices!
Hi Charlie!
Hey, Joey!
And uh oh you're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend.
Huh?
I was kidding.
I know Rachel.
I know.
Come.
Please come in, come in.
Okay, ah, well , we brought you some wine.
Oh!
That is so thoughtful.
She's a keeper.
What did you bring me, huh?
Actually that's uh...
Underwear, toothbrush, and uh Van Halen CD.
I can use all these things!
Gosh, you know, Ross.
You seem a little ...  What?
Fine?
Because I am!
Huh?
Aren't you?
Who, who else is fine?
Okay, listen, hey, Ross, why don't you , uh try to relax, okay?
Maybe have a drink.
You know what?
That is a very good idea!
I'm gonna go make a pitcher of margaritas.
I can't wait to be with you.
I'll sneak over as soon as I can.
I'll tell Rachel I'll be doing laundry.
Laundry.
Is that my new nickname?
You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big Would you stop looking at me like that?
Was the chord at least right before No.
Oh, my God!
We heard about your pants.
I'm so sorry.
This year was supposed to be great.
It's only the second day and I'm a loser... ...with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
You're not a loser.
Look at me!
Hey, look!
Ben drew a picture of you.
You're a cowboy.
Because of the leather pants?
He thinks you're a cowboy, not a loser.
That's something.
It really is something.
Howdy, partner.
Maybe I should get another pair.
You know, they had some... ...with fringe all down the sides.
Phoebe, you may know this.
I'm gonna go kiss Ben good night.
I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.
I would make a good cowboy.
Now that everything's wrapped up, I'll do my laundry.
Yeah, me too.
If this shirt is dirty.
I'm going to the airport.
If I hang around there long enough... ...someone's bound to leave a plane unattended.
Good luck, honey.
Bye.
Remember that thing I was gonna tell you about?
I won't tell you.
But if you found out on your own... ...that would be okay and we could talk about it.
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret.
So that would be okay.
Would you mind going into Chandler's bedroom... ...and getting that book he borrowed from me?
Now?
You want me to go over there now?
Do you know something?
Do you?
I might know something.
I might too.
What do you know?
You tell me first.
I can't.
Then I can't.
Okay, fine.
You don't know.
I'll walk into his bedroom and see the thing...
...I think I know is actually the thing I think I know!
Oh, this is unbelievable!
How long have you known?
Too long!
I've been dying to talk to someone about this!
You can't say anything to anybody.
They're so weird about that.
It's raining.
I don't like to fly in the rain.
I am gonna go for a walk in the rain.
Me too.
That's weird.
I bet they're doing it.
Okay, look.
I can't take it anymore.
So you win.
Okay?
Here.
Flying a jet?
Make it a spaceship... ...so you can get back to your home planet!
Phone call for you.
Tom Jones.
He wants his pants back!
And Hornswoggle?
What, are you dating a character from Fraggle Rock
It's just a little thing.
While we think it's marvelous you'rehaving this baby out of wedlock..   our friends are less openminded.
We told them you're married.What?
Thanks for going along with this.
We have to pretend that we're married?I had to shave my ears.
You can do this.
Can you believe that?I know.
If you do the ears, you may as welltake a pass at the nose.
I don't want to have to lieabout being married.
I don't either.
But it's their party,and it's one night.
We don't have to lie.We won't talk.
If it comes up,we'll smile, we'll nod along..   Ross?Rachel?
Hi, Aunt Lisa.
Uncle Dan.
Congratulations on the babyand on the wedding.
He's a little enthusiastic.What's wrong with that?
It's so much.Well, so what?
I like him.
Do I make fun of the people you date?Tag, Janice, Mona.
So we never got to hearabout your wedding.
We were surprised we weren't invited.No, it was a small wedding.
But it was beautiful.It was small, but kind of spectacular.
Where did you have it?On a cliff in Barbados, at sunset.
And Stevie Wonder sang " lsn't SheLovely" as I walked down the aisle.
Stevie's a family friend.Oh, my God.
That's amazing.
I'd love to see pictures.Yeah, so would I.
You wouldn't think Annie Liebowitzwould forget to put film in the camera.
Would you excuse us for a second?
What are you doing?What?
This may be my only wedding.
And I want it to be amazing.Okay.
Maybe I rode in on a Harley.Ross, it has to be realistic.
Say, are you okay?You seem kind of quiet.
If you want to, I could justhold them down and you could just..   And my veil was lace,made by blind Belgian nuns.
Blind?Not at first, but it's intricate work.
They said even though they losttheir sight, it was worth it.
I bet you looked beautiful.Well, I don't know.
But there were some people that saidI looked like a floating angel.
How did you propose?Oh, yeah, that's a great story.
Well, actually, I took herto the planetarium.
That's where we had our first date.
I had the room filled with lilies,her favorite flower.
That is so sweet!I want to hear the rest!
Then Fred Astaire singing,"The Way You Look Tonight" came on..   the lights came down,I got on one knee..   and written across the dome,in the stars, were the words:   "Will you marry me?"
And the ring was the size of my fist.
Hey, Phoebe?
We could've gone from the ceremony tothe reception with you in the sidecar.
It just isn't feasible.
But a dove placing the ring on yourfinger would've been no problem.
It was fun being married to you.Yeah, and it was an easy 400 bucks.
Okay, Ross, can I ask you something?Yeah.
That proposal at the planetarium?I know, I know.
It was stupid.
Are you kidding?
With the lilies,and the song and the stars?
It was really wonderful.Did you just make that up?
I thought of itwhen we were going out.
That's how I imaginedI would ask you to marry me.
Wow.
Well, that would've beenvery hard to say no to.
It's a good thing I didn't do it, itsounds like a very expensive wedding.
Okay, good night.Good night.
Even if the sidecar had a windscreento protect your hair?
I will think about it.That's all I'm asking.
Okay, that's it.
Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice.
Oh!
How does this look?
Well, it's a little low... pick it up a little...  a little bit more... little bit more...
There you go!
Now throw it away!
C'mon!
This looks good!
Ross, please, trust me.
I buy 30 fashion magazines a month.
Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but...
I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.
Damn it!
I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow.
You're more than welcome to come with us, right?
Really?
That would be great.
I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress.
I can see why, nice shirt!
You're wearing the same shirt.
Stupid Gap on every corner!
Please, make yourselves comfortable and I will be back in a moment with Erica.
You know, we should just go, I¡¯m not gonna find anything here!
This stuff is ridiculous!
Ah, this place is great!
Wow!
Rach, come on, I¡¯m not gonna wear any of this!
Nothing silver.
Ok?
Nothing with hair!
And nothing with padlocks on it!
Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater!
I mean, this is just beautiful!
Wow, this is really soft.
Three hundred and fifty dollars?
Down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!
Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.
Hey, check this out!
It¡¯s totally you!
Wow!
Yeah!
Wow!
Actually this looks pretty good!
Yeah!
Boys will be boys?
What?
They will be!
All right, that¡¯s it, I¡¯m getting out of here.
You know, there¡¯s other stuff.
Here¡¯s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...  Huh, actually these might look pretty good on me.
Yes, they will!
You know what you should do?
Just go take a walk, all right?
I know your size and I¡¯m... I¡¯m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.
Really?
Yes!
And I know what looks sexy on guys.
Please, just wear what I suggest, and she¡¯s gonna go nuts for you.
So, you¡¯re saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?
Why do men keep talking to me like this?
We got some really great stuff!
Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got.
Oh!
Really?
Do you wanna try some of them on for me?
Oh!
okay.
Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?
Oh, no!
I took one of Ross' bags by mistake, and one of mine is missing.
oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.
So?
What do you think?
I think we're not wearing the same shirt anymore!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Rachel picked it out for me.
She told me to trust her and you know what?I'm glad I did!
I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.
Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
Looks like someone IS the ladies!!
You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off.
Yeah, now if you'll excuse me, I have a date.
See?
ALL eyes on ME!
Ok,I mean there are things you do..and you know, things.. that you don't do    Wow, this place looks great.
Oh!
You are gonna love it!
and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this.
Me too!
Here..
So this was fun!
The One With the Girl Who Hits Joey You know what I just realized?
If you guys have kids We're having kids?
I call godfather!
You can't just call godfather.
Shouldn't her brother be godfather?
Sure.
If you cared enough to call it first.
You're a few steps ahead of us.
Big zero gravity moon steps.
I just thought of the greatest wedding gift.
I'll go in on that with you.
I couldn't decide.
Hey, Katie.
This is Katie.
You ready to go?
I'll run to the bathroom.
She is so cute.
You could fit her in your pocket.
She could fit in that little pocket inside the pocket.
I don't know.
I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but...
But what?
She keeps punching me.
In the cute, little sweet way she just did?
It's a lot harder than it looks.
She's hurting me.
I know what you need.
You need a bodyguard.
What is Ben doing after preschool?
Joey is having a problem.
A little girl is beating him up.
Joey, come here.
Honey, I know.
This must be really difficult for you, and I'm sorry, am I hurting you?
You were so funny with that waiter.
You're such a nut!
You know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
No, you make them funny.
You're the funny one!
Look, Katie.
Listen, we need to talk, okay?
Look, I like you.
I really do.
I like you a lot.
But sometimes when you playfully punch me like that... ...it feels like I'm being hit with a very tiny but a very real bat!
Like I could hurt you.
Are you making fun of my size?
You look big.
Thanks, I've been working out.
Listen, is it obvious I'm wearing six sweaters?
But it's not obvious why.
I'm breaking up with Katie, so I put on some extra padding.
If she hits me when she is happy, can you imagine how hard she'll hit... ...when I take away the Joey love?
Oh, right.
I forgot that you call it that.
Hey, cute jacket.
Thanks.
That's so sweet!
Ouch!
Did Joey tell you to say that?
You guys are too much!
You know what?
I gotta tell you...
...I think you're the one that is too much.
Joey has the nicest friends.
And the nicest girlfriend.
You're so sweet!
She just kicked me.
Aren't you going to do something?
Do something or I'll walk out that door right now.
Or you would have seen a Chandlershaped hole in that door.

I get to have sex with the star of the play!
People can hear you.
I know!
She looks great, doesn't she?
That is one goodlooking man.
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?
So you been doing this long?
No.
You're my first.
Put the money on the table.
That's nice.
Dude!
Is that an expensive blouse?
If you want it to be.
Here's your girlfriend's button.
The One with Rachel's Crush Do you still have your old blouses and dresses from high school?
How was Kathy's play?
Kathy gets halfnaked and simulates sex with a real goodlooking guy.
It's like somebody wrote down my worst nightmare... ...and then charged me $32 to see it.
That's a good idea for a business.
I'm totally screwed.
They're gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night... ...then they'll go to their cast parties, and he's gonna try to undermine me.
He'll be like, "Where's your boyfriend?
What's his name?
Chester?"
She'll go, "It's Chandler."
He'll go, "Whatever!"
That is a good trick.
All right, look.
What am I going to do?
They're actors.
They're there to do a job.
It doesn't mean they're gonna get together.
Just because it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins... ...doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
They're not a couple.
I get the game now.
All these people were in movies together.
When they were doing it on stage, was it really hot?
Oh, yeah.
So you're fine.
The rule is when two actors are actually doing it offstage... ...then all the sexual tension between them is gone.
As long as it's hot on stage, you got nothing to worry about.
When the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
Really?
You guys have been to every play I've been in.
Have I ever had chemistry on stage?
No.
No!
Are you gonna go see the play with me tonight?
I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between them.
I know, but No, I'm there.
Want some pancakes?
There was no chemistry between them.
Before, they had heat.
Now, there's no heat.
You know what this means.
Joey told us what this means.
Let's not jump to any conclusions.
There was some sexual chemistry.
Come on.
It was like cousins having sex.
Here she comes.
Don't say a word.
Just be cool.
Don't be, you know, you.
Hey, you guys!
Thank you so much for coming again.
Did you like it tonight?
Absolutely.
Wasn't Nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit?
It's a good play, isn't it?
I loved the play.
You were great.
And Nick, ditto.
Clearly, you're having sex with him.
Okay... Clearly, I'm having sex with him?
It was so obvious.
There was no chemistry between you two.
You're accusing me of cheating on you, and you're insulting my performance?
I can see how this could happen.
You're up there every night naked, touching, kissing.
Acting.
Chandler, this is my job.
I'm playing a part in a play.
How can you not trust me?
You can understand, given how we started.
I can't believe you're throwing that in my face.
That is what happened.
I don't even see you denying this.
I'll tell you what, Chandler.
You call me when you grow up.
Don't expect that to happen any time soon!
I have the best job in the entire world!
Oh, isn't this nice?
It's so quiet.
I could just lie here all day.
Oh, I know.
Open your drapes!
Open your drapes!
So glad we got adjoining rooms.
The sun is out!
Hey!
Remember when I had corneas?
Go to the pool and reserve chairs.
I will get the magazines and the lotion.
Ladies?
Ross' speech is in 45 minutes.
No!
Damn it!
Walls are pretty thin, guys.
"Then we have to weigh the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing..   which call into question information gathered from years of carbon dating."
Look at the woman sitting out by the pool getting tan.
She's all leathery and wrinkled.
I'm so jealous!
"Finally, factor in the profusion of new species recently discovered.
Giganotosaurus.
Argentinosaurus."
Not to mention Coldsaurus.
"And that's just the herbivores.
I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores.
Their heads are already too big.
Which is ironic, considering their stunted cerebral development."
Really?
"But all kidding aside, in much the same way..   that Homo ergaster is thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus.."    What?
He said "erectus."
You're kidding, right?
No, he really said it.
"And while there are certainly vast differences..   between these Mesozoic fossils and the example of Homo erectus.."   Erectus?
Homo.
Right.
"In a very real way, we can bring the Mesozoic Era into the 21st century."
Thank you.
Really great.
Oh, thanks, guys.
I thought it was wonderful.
Jarvis Oberblau.
Cornell.
I mean, the ideas you put forth, and from someone so young and..
Okay, now we're just holding hands.
Alrighty.
We're gonna hit the beach.
That was really great.
Oh, thank you.
Yeah.
Oh, and so funny.
Take it easy.
All right, thanks.
Thanks so much.
I can't tell you how much it means that you were here.
You kidding?
We wouldn't have missed it.
I'm back.
Okay.
Well, excuse me?
Well?
You were incredible.
You blew them away.
I can't tell you how great it was to look in the crowd and see your face.
I mean, did you know you were mouthing the words along with me?
I was not.
No, it's okay.
It made me feel like a rock star.
Oh, my God.
I'm your groupie.
Hey, I better not find you naked in my hotel room.
Look, I took it too far.
What the hell are you doing?
Look, I was nervous.
You guys had me all worried I was gonna be boring.
I got up there and they were all, like, staring at me.
I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
Yeah, and not a very good one.
Will you, please...?
Dr. Geller?
Kurt Rathman.
I'm a paleontology professor here.
Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
I'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister.
Monica Geller.
Right.
Will you excuse us for one moment?
What are you doing?
You can have an accent, but I can't?
Top of the morning to you, laddies!
Would you just please stop?
Yes, yes, Bombay is very, very nice this time of year.
You stole them from me!
You stole them from me!
Give me them!
Just wanna each take one?
Yeah, that seems fair.
We never use them.
Look, I really need some help, okay?
Why did I have to speak in a British accent?
What do I do?
Why don't you call Mummy and Daddy?
Why don't you phase it out?
Yeah, phase the accent out.
People will think you're adjusting to life in America.
Come on.
No one will even notice.
They're probably not even listening to you.
They're not listening to me?
Of course they're listening to you.
Everybody listens to you.
Monica, do you think I should try this phasingout thing?
I think you look fine.
Whenever you're ready.
Really?
Really?
Okay.
Hello, Ross?
This is Dr. McNeely from the Fake Accent University.
We'd like you to come onboard fulltime!
Listen to this!
My reading was wrong.
I'm not going to die.
Really?
How do you know?
My psychic is dead!
She must have read the cards wrong.
I'm sorry.
Better her than me.
Hello, is Ross there?
No, he's not.
Can I take a message?
Yes, this is Russell, Ross' divorce lawyer.
Since I haven't heard from him, I assume he's giving the marriage a try.
Ross got married again?
All right, keep going.
We are phasing the accent out.
Phasing it out.
"So without retesting their results in the laboratory... the team would never have identified... the initial errors in their carbon dating...
analysis."
Were there any questions at this point?
What's happening to your accent?
Come again?
What's this nonsense?
All right.
I'm not English.
I'm from Long Island.
I was really nervous, and the accent... just came out.
I'm sorry.
So if we could just get back to the lecture.
Were there any questions?
About paleontology?
I was just trying to make a good first impression.
Obviously, I screwed up.
But what you guys think of me is important... because I'm hoping to get a permanent job here.
So if you'd just give me another chance to make a good impression.. Ross!
Are you crazy?
We're just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
Why didn't you come up?
Done.
You just finished?
I wanted to be thorough.
This is clearly very important to you.
To us.
I wanted to read every word carefully.
Twice.
Does it?
I'm sorry?
Does it?
Does it?
Does it?
I wanted to give that whole "Does it?"
part another glance.
What do you mean?
You said you read it twice.
It either does or doesn't.
If you have to think No, I don't have to think about it.
In fact...
...I've decided.
I have decided... ...that it... ...does.
Are you sure?
Sure, I'm sure!
I'm ready to get the hell out of here.
Are you?
That's so great!
Not for Bonnie.
But for you, yea!
How was the beach?
Nothing.
I don't know.
What happened?
I have to go pack!
And it really does?
It does.
It really and truly does.
It so does not!
She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong.
She goes on for five pages about how I was unfaithful to her.
We were on a break!
If you say that one more time, I'll break up with you.
This breakup was not all my fault.
She says here... ..."If you accept full responsibility...
...I can begin to trust you again.
Does that seem like something you can do?
Does it?"
You have what you want.
You're back with her.
If you bring this up now, you'll wreck it.
Yeah, I know.
You're right.
I'll let it go.
But you know how hard it is to forget this?
Sure, it's hard... ...but you don't have to talk about it.
A lot happened on that trip... ...that we should never, ever talk about.
What happened on that beach?
It's between us and the sea, Ross.
Let it go, Ross.
You didn't know ChiChi.
Do you all promise?
Yeah, we promise.
We'll be good.
Chandler, do you promise to be good?
You can come in, but your filter tip little buddy stays outside!
"Dear Ms. Buffay: Thank you for calling.
We have credited your account $500.
We're sorry for the inconvenience and hope you'll accept this football phone as our gift. "
Do you believe it?
Now I have $ 1 000 and a football phone.
What bank is this?
Okay, it's him.
Who is it?
Alan.
Chandler!
He's here!
Please be good.
Please?
Just remember how much you all like me.
Alan, this is everybody.
Everybody, this is Alan.
I've heard so much about all you guys.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Let's let the Alanbashing begin.
Who's gonna take the first shot?
Come on!
I'll go.
Let's start with the way he kept picking at.
I'm sorry, I can't do this.
Can't do it.
We loved him.
We loved him!
Wait a minute!
We're talking about someone I'm going out with?
And did you notice?
Know what was great?
The way his smile was crooked.
Yes!
Like the man in the shoe!
What shoe?
From the nursery rhyme.
"There was a crooked man with a crooked smile who lived in a shoe for a while."
So I think Alan is the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
What future boyfriends?
I think this could be, you know, "it. "
Really?
I'd marry him for his David Hasselhoff impression alone.
You know I'll be doing that at parties, right?
Know what I like most about him?
What?
The way he makes me feel about myself.
How was the game?
Well.
We won!
Fantastic!
One question: How is that possible?
Alan.
He was unbelievable!
He was like a Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs plays every position.
But instead of Bugs, it was 1 st base, Alan.
2nd base, Alan.
It was like he made us into a team.
We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers a thing or two about softball.
Can I ask you guys a question?
Do you think Alan is maybe sometimes.
What?
I don't know.
A little too "Alan"?
Oh, no.
That's not possible.
You can never be too "Alan. "
It's his innate "Alanness" that we adore.
I, personally, could have a gallon of Alan.
Joey, do you know we can see you from here?
How come Richard looks cooler with one of these?
You may wanna light it and lose the spatula.
It's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
Not like him, per se.
Just not unlike him.
It's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
I'm just trying something here, you know?
Why didn't you grow a mustache?
We flipped for it.
I got the cigar, he got the mustache.
If we both grew them, we'd look like dorks.
You really sidestepped that land mine.
I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.
You're meeting Richard?
Ranger game.
Didn't he tell you?
It should've been called: "It's a Sucky Life, And Just When You Think It Can't Suck Anymore, It Does!"
IKick, save!
And... ...denied!
He gets it back.
Pass to the middle, lines it up...
Yes!
Could that shot be any prettier?
Man, you are incredible.
We had a table in college.
Really?
I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800s.
Nice mustache.
At puberty, that thing will really kick in.
Not to sound too Florence Henderson, but dinner's on the table.
One more point.
Score!
Now can we go?
That's why we don't let her play.
Is everything all right?
Don't be mad at him.
It's our fault.
I'm sorry we've been hogging his time.
He's just really great to hang out with.
Well...  No, seriously.
We just talked about this.
He is so much cooler than our dads.
Our dads are okay and all, but Richard is just What are you kicking me for?
I'm trying to talk here.
You guys see me as a dad?
Oh, yeah!
No!
You're just clearly not familiar with our young persons' vernacular.
When we say "dad," we mean "buddy."
We mean "pal."
No, seriously.
Joey's my dad.
Monica's my dad.
I've even got some dads down at work.
That's fine.
Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening.
I'll just see you kids around.
Nightynight.
You're not a dad!
I can't believe you got us into trouble.
So are you okay?
Just...
...I feel like I'm about a hundred.
I thought I was just one of the guys.
Come here.
I'll make you feel like one of the guys.
For a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.
I was killing them.
Yeah, well they suck too.
So how come you wanted to eat in tonight?
Because I wanted... ...to give you this.
Are you a puppy!
Contact paper!
What do you say when someone you're sleeping with... ...gives you contact paper?
Wait, there's more.
See, the contact paper is to go... ...in your brand new drawer!
See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
You didn't have to do this.
Yes, I did.
Yes, I did.
Because you're my girlfriend... ...and that's what girlfriends should get.
Well, I gotta buy a vowel... ...because, oh, my God!
Who would've thought that someday... ...Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer?
Well, not me.
But that's what's happened.
And there's more.
We should take a trip.
We should?
We're a couple, and that's what couples do.
And I wanna meet your parents.
We should take a trip with your parents!
I don't think we need to because you're tripping me out right now!
Are you okay?
No, I am.
I actually am!
This is amazing.
My entire life, I have feared this place.
And now that I'm here, it's like, what was the big deal?
I could probably say, "Let's move in together," and I'd be okay.
You probably want us to move in together?
It doesn't scare me!
Yeah, well it scares me!
I'm not even divorced yet!
You just invited me over here for pasta... ...and now you're talking about moving in together.
And I wasn't even that hungry.
You know what?
It's getting really late, and I should just... Don't go!
I've scared you!
I've said too much!
I'm hopeless and awkward and desperate for love!
Hey, Janice, it's me.
I wanted to apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
Here you go, honey.
This will help.
So I catch up to her and she says... ...this relationship's going too fast and we have to slow down.
That is never good.
Then I got all... ...needy and clingy.
Maybe it's not so bad.
How did you leave it?
She said she'd call me.
Oh, God.
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
And then I just, you know... ...threw the bag of barley at her and ran out of the store.
My God, Chandler, we said be "aloof," not "a doof."
I've actually ruined this, haven't I?
Is it time for the good ice cream now?
It's time.
Yeah, it is.
Everything's gonna be okay.
You know why?
Because you got 65 grams of fat coming your way.
Hello?
Hi, Janice.
Can you hold on for a second?
Okay.
Okay.
What do I do?
I don't know.
This is unprecedented.
If we did what you did, a man would never call.
I got it!
Pretend you just woke up.
That'll throw her off!
Be sleepy!
Yes!
And grumpy!
What are you...?
Stop naming dwarfs!
Hello, Janice?
Hi.
I'm so glad that you called.
I know I've been acting really weird lately... ...and it's just because I'm crazy about you... ...and I just got stupid and scared... ...and stupid a couple more times.
And I'm sorry.
Really?
He's so lucky.
If Janice were a guy... ...she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.
I love you too.
It's so unfair!
G.I.
What are you doing?
Emma was doing it.
She's asleep.
She's asleep.
That means we can..
Yes.
But we have to be fast.
Oh, okay, I'll try.
And you can't make any noise.
Okay, I'll try.
Hello?
Emma?
Hey!
Hi!
How are you?
How are you?
Where are your babysitters, huh?
Why is the bedroom door closed?
You can't have SEX when you're taking care of a BABIE.
Well, that was weird.
You were loud and I was fast.
I think we may have really done it this time.
I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.
You may want to get some more of those too.
Where's Emma?
Oh, my God, where's Emma?
Where's Emma?
Don't ask me.
I was in there canoodling you.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma.
You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.
You better hope we're pregnant..   because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel!
Because you two were having sex!
No, we weren't.
Don't you lie to me.
I can tell by Chandler's hair.
You are so lazy.
Can't you get on top for once?
All right.
All right, we were.
We're trying to make a baby.
Monica's ovulating.
It's unacceptable that you'd have sex with Emma in the next room.
I'll have to tell Rachel about this.
Please don't.
She will kill us.
Hey, I gotta.
Unless..
Unless what?
Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.
What?
Why?
Hey, I may never have kids..   and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.
Your family name is Tribbiani.
You almost had me.
Now wait a minute.
So they're gonna name their first child Joey?
How do I get them to name the next one after me?
It's easy.
You just walk in on them having sex.
Oh, so they owe me, like, three Phoebes.
Oh, my God!
Look, it's Ross and Rachel!
The plan is working!
Don't do the plan laugh.
The first dates we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.
You know, it is weird..   that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful..   on the same night Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.
Wait a minute.
You don't think it was intentional?
I mean, that's just stupid.
We're geniuses.
Look at them!
They're really bonding.
They're falling in love all over again.
Oh, they see us.
Oh, they look mad.
They figured it out.
They're coming.
Run!
Where?
Mexico!
Can you believe they're still not here?
I know.
A double blind date and we both get stood up.
What are the chances?
I know, I'm so bummed.
Could we have our free crab cakes now?
What?
We've been stood up.
And we want our free crab cakes.
You were stood up here last night.
Guys, give it a rest.
Nobody's betting on you tonight.
Although we do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry.
I have such fat hands!
I hate my dick
Look at her,  my first grandchild.
What about Ben?
Well of course Ben, I meant my first granddaughter.
Wow.
I want a baby.
Honey, we¡¯ve been over this.
I need to be facing the other way.
Come on!
Come on, if we have sex again it¡¯ll double our chances of getting pregnant.
Do you think that closet¡¯s still available?
I¡¯m so tired.
Yeah okay, but no foreplay.
Deal!
Dad seriously!
Y¡¯know you really should see someone about that!
Noted.
I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?
Are you kidding me, I could stay and look at her forever.
Actually umm...   Hey!
Dad, what are you doing?
I think there are people in there having sex.
It can¡¯t be me, I¡¯m standing right here.
Wanna peek?
No!Come on!
Y¡¯know what?
I don¡¯t like you without mom.
Come on.
We¡¯re not peeking?
Well I¡¯m peeking.
Oh my God!
Hello sir, you know Monica.
I haven¡¯t slept in forty hours and..  it does sound like something I would do...   Look, we can¡¯t stay in here forever.
Oh, I still can¡¯t believe my dad saw us having sex!
He didn¡¯t make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!
This is okay.
We¡¯re all adults here;  there¡¯s nothing to be ashamed of.
Now, let¡¯s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.
Hi Dad!
I can still call you that right?
Of course.
I¡¯ll always be your dad.
I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there,  that wasn¡¯t for fun.
It wasn¡¯t fun?!
Why?
Whywhywould you?Whwhy...?
Look, I just don¡¯t want you to think that   we¡¯re animals who do it whenever we want.
Oh, I don¡¯t think that.
Before today I never thought of you two having sex at all.
It was a simpler time.
The truth is, Dad, we¡¯rewe¡¯re trying.
What?
Yeah, we¡¯re trying to get pregnant.
Oh my God!
This is so exciting!
Well, get back in there!
I¡¯ll guard the door!
Well, that¡¯s okay dad, wewe can wait until later.
Whoawhoawhoa!
I don¡¯t think so!
Aren¡¯t you ovulating?
Daddy?!
Well you gotta get at it princess!
When your mother and I were trying to conceive you,  whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it.
That¡¯s how I got my bad hip.
That¡¯s funny, this conversation¡¯s how I got the bullet hole in my head.
This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she was...  Daddy!
I don¡¯t think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.
You¡¯re right, you¡¯re right.
This is about your positions.
Now, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child,   although it might feel good.
I don¡¯t feel good right now.
But pleasure is important, and it helps if the woman has an orgasm.
You up to the task sailor?
Seriously sir, my brains?
All over the wall.
Hey.Hey.
Kids, I spoke to a doctor   and picked up this pamphlets on how to get pregnant.
Hey dad!
Sorry to bother you again, but could you pass my pamphlets back?
Thank you
Burning the midnight oil.You know me, sir.
Do you know how I can get aroundthe office computer network..   so I can accessthe really good Internet porn?
You're a joker, Bing.
What's funny about that?
Sorry I kept you waiting so long.That's okay.
Where do you wanna go?
I think you know where I wanna go.
The Hard Rock Cafe?Yeah.
Again?Yeah.
I'm telling you, I like the food.You like the Purple Rain display.
Hey, Bob.Hey, Toby.
Have a good night.
Did that guy just call you Toby?Yeah, he thinks that's my name.
Why don't you correct him?It's been going on way too long now.
The first time, we were just passingeach other, so I didn't say anything.
The next time he said,"Toby, want a doughnut?"
I wanted the doughnut.
Five years later, the doughnut's goneand I'm still Toby.
Chandler, you have to tell him.That would be so awkward.
We don't work together.He's on the sixth floor.
So he calls me Toby once in a while.
It's not like he's calling me Muriel.
Muriel.Why would he call you Muriel?
Oh, my God.
Chandler "M." Bing.
It's not just an "M."Your middle name is Muriel!
It is a family name.
Chandler Muriel Bing.
Your parents never evengave you a chance, did they?
Drake, I've discovered the reasonfor your memory loss.
Hey, Bob.How's my pal Toby doing today?
If I see him, I'll ask.
Was that Bob from sixyou were just talking to?
Yeah.You know him?
We're on a semifirstname basis.
What about adding him to our team?Bob?
Working here with us?
Every day?I don't know if he has what it takes.
They love him down on six.But this is 11.
It's almost twice as hard up here.
Okay, Bob will stay put.I think it's best, sir.
We do need to find somebody.Work is starting to pile up.
I've got a stackof documents this high.
Just toss them in the shredderand claim you never got them.
That's a good one, Bing.
What does a guy have to doto be taken seriously around here?
Toby, you got a sec?Sure.
What's up?
I wanted to get transferred up here,but it's not gonna happen.
Apparently somebody thinksI'm not "11thfloor material."
Say, who the hell is this Chandler?
What's the best excuse for whyI'm not drinking on this date tonight?
Hey, Toby?Hey, Bobby.
It's Bob, actually.
You work up here.
Where'sChandler Bing's office?
Yeah, it's right..
Right there.Let me ask you, why?
I wanna talk to that bastard,see what his problem is.
Okay, Bob.
Listen.
I'm the reason you didn't get the job.
Toby, don't.Bob.
Toby, I'm not gonna let you coverfor him.
Anything you say will just get memore upset with Chandler.
That puts mein a difficult position.
You do anything to Chandler,it's gonna bring you down to his level.
Bob?
Bob!
Bob!
What the hell are you doing?This is Chandler's office.
Come on, Toby.
Give me a hand
Rachel, what are you up to tonight?
I was supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon.
So, nothing.
Right.
You're not even getting your honeymoon.
Although, Aruba.
This time of year?
Talk about your big lizards.
If you don't feel like being alone tonight Joey and Chandler are helping me with my furniture.
And we're very excited about it.
Thanks.
But I'm just gonna hang out here.
It's been a long day.
Okay.
Sure.
Pheebs, wanna help?
I wish I could, but I don't want to.
Love is sweet as summer showers Love is a wondrous work of art But your love, oh, your love Your love Is like a giant pigeon Crapping on my heart Thank you!
I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things using a bunch of these little worm guys.
I have no brackety thing.
I see no worm guys whatsoever and I cannot feel my legs.
We got a bookcase here.
I have no idea.
Done with the bookcase.
All finished.
This was Carol's favorite beer.
She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.
If you start with that, we're out of here.
Let me ask you a question.
She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV.
What did you get?
You guys.
You got screwed.
I don't think that was my point.
You know what's scary?
What if there is only one woman for everybody?
I mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it?
Unfortunately, in my case, there was only one woman for her.
What are you talking about?
One woman.
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you.
Let me tell you something.
There's lots of flavors out there.
Rocky road, and cookie dough, and bing cherry vanilla.
You can get them with jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream.
This is the best thing that ever happened to you!
You got married.
You were like, what?
Eight?
Welcome back to the world.
Grab a spoon!
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
Then stay out of my freezer.
Could you give this to that guy over there?
Go ahead.
Thank you.
Hey.
Thank you so much.
No, no, no.
Don't thank me.
Thank the jerk that didn't show up.
Okay, I gotta get to work.
And not just for the money.
You need some help with that?
No, thanks.
I got it.
No.
No, I don't!
Okay?
Stood up too fast.
Got a little head rush.
It's the heat.
And the humidity.
That's a... That's a tough combination.
Do you want to come in for some lemonade?
Like you wouldn't believe.
This is a great place.
Thank you.
Just make yourself comfortable.
Gotcha.
So this place is really my grandmother's.
I got it from her when she moved to Florida.
Otherwise I could never afford a place like this.
So if the landlord ever asks...
...I'm an 87yearold woman who's afraid of her VCR.
You thirsty?
You bet I am!
Okay... ...here's your penis!
Oh, my God!
What the hell are you doing?
You said, "You wanna come in for some lemonade?"
So?
Were you just gonna give me lemonade?
Cover yourself up!
Oh, right.
Sorry.
God, I don't believe this!
Someone asks you in for lemonade and to you that means they want to have sex?
Usually, yeah.
Well, not just lemonade.
Iced tea, sometimes juice.
Look, sorry.
I just...
I thought you liked me.
I'm such a jerk.
It's okay.
I suppose it could happen to anyone.
Not anyone I know, but... By the way, I can still see it.
Pheebs?
Huh?
Where's your bed?
So, what are you watching?
Baywatch.
What's it about?
Lifeguards.
Well, it sounds kind of stup... Who's she?
Nicole Eggert.
We like her.
Wow!
Look at them run!
They do that a lot.
Hey, you want a beer?
Yeah, I'll go get one.
Don't get up.
I got a cooler right here.
Hello!
Hey.
Do you have any beers?
We're out of beers.
Help yourself.
You okay?
Phoebe moved out.
Right.
I don't understand.
Am I so hard to live with?
Is this why I don't have a boyfriend?
No!
You don't have a boyfriend because...
I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend.
You should have a boyfriend.
Well, I think so.
Come here.
Listen, you are one of my favorite people... ...and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life.
Because Carol's a lesbian.
You know, it's supposed to be... How's that coffee coming, dear?
Right away, Mr. Kaplan.
I'm not suppose to drink coffee.
It makes me gassy.
I know.
I'll bet you're thinking, "What's an intelligent girl... ...who wants to be in fashion doing making coffee?"
You got me.
Don't think I haven't noticed your potential.
I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion.
How does that sound?
That sounds great!
Come on over here, sweetheart.
Thank you so much.
I need these hangers separated ASAP.
You're welcome.
Oh, God, I hate my job!
I hate it.
I know, honey.
I'm sorry.
I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out.
Then I think: "Why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job... ...just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in?"
Gee, I don't know, Rach.
Order up!
Yentl soup, James Beans and a Howdy, hold the Doody.
Come on, I'm sorry.
I didn't...
I don't mind paying my dues, you know?
But how much will I learn about fashion... ...by walking Myra, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom?
Hi.
Is my misery amusing to you?
I'm sorry, I was just...
It's not funny.
This is actually my job.
No, believe me, I've been there.
I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
Well, then.
I'm just gonna go back to talking to my friend here.
You can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
Actually, that's a Barbra Streisandwich.
I work at Bloomingdale's.
I might know of a job possibility, if you're interested.
Do you want my pickle?
Hey, guys.
Hey, Gunther.
The most unbelievable thing happened today.
I'm having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me.
He works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's.
There's an opening there!
So I gave him my phone number.
He's gonna call me this weekend to get me an interview!
I know!
What, so this guy's helping you for no apparent reason?
And he's a total stranger?
Yeah.
His name is Mark something.
Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex!
What?
I'm just saying.
Why else would he swoop in out of nowhere for no reason?
To be nice.
Hey, Joey, are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
No, only for sex.
Thank you.
So did you tell Mark Something about me?
I didn't have to.
I was wearing my "I Heart Ross" sandwich board and ringing my bell.
Joey!
So he's "just a nice guy."
Do you really think this Mark doesn't want anything for helping you?
Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him.
But, you know, that's true of any job.
How you feeling?
Well, my apartment isn't there anymore because I drank it.
Where'd you go?
We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
No "woohooing."
No "woohooing."
Why, what happened?
I fooled around with Joey's sister.
That's not the worst part.
What is the worst part?
I can't remember which sister.
You see what men do?
Don't tell me men are nice.
This is men!
Are you insane?
What are you doing here?
You know, this building's on my paper route, so... How did it go?
The woman I interviewed with was pretty tough... ...but thank God Mark coached me.
Once I talked about the Fall line, she got all happy.
I'm so proud of you.
Me too!
Listen, I'm...
I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous and...
It's just, I like you a lot, so...
I know.
Yeah?
Rachel.
Hi.
Hi, Mark.
I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you.
You got the job.
If it's any consolation... ...he really did sound like he was having more fun with you
What is the matter with us?
Oh, I know what's the matter with me.
No, I mean with us.
You know?
I mean it's just supposed to be this...  difficult?
I don't know.
That fake British woman's a real bitch but she sure can dance.
Hey /Hi  Hey, listen.
Can I ask you a question?
When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from  friends to more than that?
Kinda, you know, sneaking around having to hide from you guys.
No, no, no, no, I mean...  Sexually.
Yeah, I...Was there a part of you that, that felt like it was ....  really wrong?
Actually no.
No, it felt right.
You know?
It felt like, uh,  I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.
I can tell from your expressions that's the good news you were hoping for.
Well, I'm gonna go continue to spread the joy.
Well, just becuase that happened that way for them  doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.
Yeah, yeah.
Absolutely.
I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.
Right, totally.
/ Yeah.
So we just keep trying and trying until we do it.
Yeah, and if it doesn't work,  then we'll just be one of those couples that never have sex!
That's a plan!
I did not see this coming.
I know.
I don't get it.
I mean..
I was so sure this is what I wanted.
Me too.
How come Monica and Chandler could do it?
I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
Oh....
I bet you're right.
So...    Yeah.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Alright, I'm going to bed.
Yeah, me too.
Oh, yeah.
I'm not going anywhere for a while.
Dude, it's Chandler, let me in.
I really had a good time.
Yeah, me too.
I guess this is it.
Unless you want to come inside?
Wait a minute.
You know what?
I can't decide this.
Okay.
Just hold on a second.
Where's Monica?
I have to ask her something.
Doing her laundry.
What's that?
It came in the mail today.
It's 72 longstemmed red roses.
One for each day I've known and loved Emily... ...cut up into mulch.
Honey, that's awful.
It's not so bad.
Monica's going to make potpourri.
I think I'm going to go wander out in the rain for a while.
It's not raining.
I can't catch a break!
You're not going anywhere.
Sit right here.
I'll make you some tea and we'll talk this out.
All right?
Hey, Dave.
I need to take a rain check.
My roommate is really sick.
Okay.
Bye!
Honey, listen.
I know things seem so bad... ...and that they won't get any Could I talk to you?
I dropped some socks.
What is the matter with you?
Do you want to fall into the trap?
You did not drop any socks!
I saw Dave, and he said you blew him off!
You listen to me!
I'm calling the shots!
I say you leave Ross and go get Dave.
Well, ultimately I was trying, you know, I wanted... ...to tell him that I'm still in love with him.
What?
You cannot tell him that!
Wasn't that nice?
No.
I make the decisions and I say no!
You know what?
No, you don't make my decisions, because... ...you're fired.
You can't fire me.
I make your decisions, and I say I'm not fired!
Ha!
Well... Come on, let me in!
Having some trouble?
Rachel locked the door.
I'll kick that door in if you give me some sugar.
Ross, there's something I wanna talk to you about.
Because I really need to tell you Thank you.
Rachel?
Can I talk to you outside for a sec?
We really need to talk.
Well, then talk.
Okay, I will.
Remember that thing we just discussed that you wanted to do?
What thing?
Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons.
Which I think is a really stupid idea.
It's dangerous.
She won't get what she wants.
And who knows who she might end up hurting?
Monica's right.
Swing dancing can be tricky.
I have to use the phone.
I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily.
My God!
Think of the massacre.
I'm going to do it.
I know you think I'm crazy.
But before you tell him, try to find one person... ...who thinks it's a good idea.
I bet you can't.
Please?
All right.
Fine.
Oh, that's a great plan!
Well, I must say this seems like  a lovely environment to raise a child in  Oh, by the way, you're more than welcome  to look under any of the furniture  because, believe me, you won't find  any porn or cigarettes under there.
Oh, actually, before we look around,  let me make sure I have everything I need up to here.
Why don't I show you the baby's room?
What the hell are you doing?
Well, you wouldn't let me in  so I thought you were in trouble!
Well, we're not!
But you called me Bert!
That's our code word for danger!
We don't have a code word!
/ We don't?
We really should  From now on, Bert will be our code word for danger.
So that was the baby's room   Ah, what room should we see next?
Any room that isn't behind this couch.
Some people don't get him  but I think he's really funny.
I did not care for that  You have to get out of here!
You slept with our social worker  and you never called her back!
And she is still pissed so she can't see you!
Oh, well, okay, okay   What?
I forgot my bat.
Oh my God!
And for the last time,  we do not want to be friends with you!
And we don't want to buy your bat!
What are you doing here?
Bert, Bert, Bert.
Are you friends with him?
I can explain   Joey.
Ah, okay, uh,...   Oh, yeah.
You have got some nerve coming back here   I can't believe you never called me!
Excuse me?
Oh, yeah.
Probably you don't even remember my name!
It's Joey, by the way.
And don't bother telling me yours  because I totally remember it  Lady   Yeah.
I waited weeks for you to call me  I gave you my number.
You never called me.
No, don't try to turn this around on me, okay?
I am not some kind of.... social work, okay?
that you can just ....do   Well, I'm pretty sure I gave you my number / Really?
Think about it.
Come on.
You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny.
We had a really good time, huh?
If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?
I don't know  Oh, maybe I'm wrong.
I'm sorry  No, no, you know, too late for apologies, okay?
You broke my heart  You know how many women I had to sleep with  to get over you?
Joey, wait!
I can't wait any more   I'm sorry that you had to see this   I'm so embarrassed  Oh, that's really okay  Yeah, I mean we totally understand.
Dating is hard  Boy, you people are nice  and I've got to say  I think you're going to make excellent parents   Laura!
Oh my God!
Really?
I can't wait to tell Chandler  Okay, good bye.
Wrong number?
It was Laura  She gave us a great report  and we are officially on the waiting list  That's great!
Yeah, we just have to wait for a call and,  and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us  Oh   Hello  Have you seen Joey's bat?
You're not still upset about what that guy told you, are you?
Wouldn't you be?
It's been a really emotional time and you've had a lot to drink... You have to let that go, okay?
You were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight.
Really?
You kidding?
You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa, what's going on?
We just made out.
We're making out?
Not anymore.
But we don't do that.
I know, I thought it would be fun.
How drunk are you?
Enough to know I want to do this.
Not so much that you should feel guilty.
That's the perfect amount.
You know what's weird?
What?
This doesn't feel weird.
I know.
You're a really good kisser.
Well, I have kissed over four women.
Want to get under the covers?
Okay.
Wow, you are really fast!
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
We're gonna see each other naked.
Yep.
At the same time?
Count of three?
One, two, three.
Well, I think it's safe to say our friendship is effectively ruined.
Eh, we weren't that close anyway.
Joey, Joey, Joey...!
Hey.
Hey, Joe.
I was just watching a movie... Oh, dude, I'm so sorry.
No!
It's cool, I'm still with my bridesmaid.
Where are the condoms?
In my bag over there.
Could you leave me one?
For just you?
Yeah.
Because it's really doing nothing for me.
If I hadn't left you one, you two might've never gotten together.
Imagine if I had sent that hooker like I was gonna?
It's like it was in the stars.
Yeah, totally meant to be.
Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
What?
What?
What?
Who did you originally want to hook up with?
Okay, fine, but please don't be upset.
I was really depressed, okay?
And really drunk.
I wanted something stupid and meaningless.
I just wanted sex.
So, when I went to your room that night...
...I was actually looking for Joey.
Yeah, baby.
No, baby.
Oh, my God.
You came looking for Joey?
Were you planning on telling me this?
No, I didn't think it was important.
It's not important?
It's not important?
If it wasn't for a bridesmaid, you'd be marrying him not me.
No.
The point is, it was you that was there that night.
Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey wasn't there?
Hey!
I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings.
There's no way you're doing this wedding now, okay?
What?
That's not fair.
It's not my fault.
I was with my bridesmaid.
And who's to say I would've said yes?
I mean, I would've said yes.
You are making way too big a deal out of this.
Everything worked out okay.
It's just weird, okay?
I don't want to be saying my vows with the mental image of you and Monica.
I need...
I don't know what I need.
I need a walk.
Wait, Chandler, it's not a big deal.
It is to me.
You wanted to sleep with Batman and settled for Robin.
This is crazy.
No, Robin is so gay.
Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged!"
The One With the Thumb "How does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over.
But you'll live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.
That was really good!
Thanks.
Let's keep going.
"So, what do you want from me, Dimon?
Huh?"
I just wanna go back to my cell, because in my cell I can smoke.
"Smoke away! "
I think this is probably why Dimon smokes in his cell alone.
What?
Relax your hand.
Let your wrist go.
Not so much.
All right.
Now try taking a puff.
Right.
Give it to me.
I'm not giving you a cigarette.
It's fine.
Do you want to get this part or not?
All right.
Now, don't think of it as a cigarette.
Think of it as the thing that has been missing from your hand.
When you're holding it, you feel right.
You feel complete.
You miss it?
No, not so much.
All right.
Now we smoke.
Oh, my God!
It's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
That's ridiculous.
Can I use either thumb?
All right.
Don't tell me.
Decaf cappuccino for Joey.
Coffee, black.
Latte.
And an iced tea.
I'm getting good at this.
Excellent!
Good for me!
You okay, Phoebe?
It's not even worth.
It's my bank.
What did they do?
I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly "statement. "
Easy!
And there's $500 extra in my account.
Satan's minions at work again!
Now I have to go down there and deal with them.
What are you talking about?
Keep it!
It's not mine.
If I kept it, it would be like stealing.
Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping.
Say I bought a great pair of shoes.
Know what I'd hear with every step I took?
"Not mine.
Not mine.
Not mine. "
And even if I was happy and skipping, I'd hear, "Notnot mine.
Notnot mine. "
We're with you.
We got it.
I'd never be able to enjoy it.
It'd be like this giant karmic debt.
Chandler, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Oh, gross!
What is this?
I'm smoking!
I'm smoking!
You've been so good for three years!
And this is my reward.
Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
So this time I won't quit.
All right!
I'm putting it out!
Oh, no!
I can't drink this now.
I'm gonna go change.
I've got a date.
Is this Alan again?
How's it going?
It's going pretty good.
It's nice and we're having fun.
When do we get to meet the guy?
Let's see, today's Monday.
Never!
Not after what happened with Steve.
What do you mean?
We love Steve.
Steve was sexy!
If you never smoke again, I'll give you $ 7000.
Yeah, all right
Hi.
Hey.
Hi.Hi.
Tea gives Phoebe the trots!
I thought Joey and lwould be okay..   but we don't knowhow to be together.
Just a little, you know.
"Joey loves you.Be prepared."
Sorry.Well, for next time.
It's tough, but things will improve.How do you know?
What if it gets worse and worse..   to the point where wecan't be in the same room?
I'm not great at the advice.
Can I interest youin a sarcastic comment?
Some cheese?
Honey, why is the Bruce Springsteen CDin the Cat Stevens case?
I really don't know what to tell you.
Maybe Joey could help you outwith your big work problem.
What?Yeah, Joey, she's..   Rachel's got this big work problem.It is a headscratcher.
Know what?
If we're gonna make dinner,we're gonna have to leave.
So you have a big work problem?
Yeah.
It's, uh..   Yeah, it's, uh..   You know, it's nothing.
Okay.
So I think I'm gonna take off.
No, wait, Joey, it is.It's something.
It's..
It's my boss.
Yeah?Yeah.
And, uh..   And my baby.
Yeah?
My boss wants to buy my baby.
What?
Oh, my God!
I know, I told you,it's a really big problem!
He wants to buy your baby?Can you believe that?
That's crazy.That's what I told him!
How did this even happen?Well, I'll tell you.
See, my boss and his wife,they can't have children, so..   And then when we wereat the Christmas party..   he got drunk and said to me,"Rachel, I want to buy your baby."
When you said it was a problemabout your boss and the baby..
I figured it wasabout maternity leave.
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah, that would have beena much simpler problem.
Hey, great advice on that Joey thing.
The work problem?lt was perfect.
It felt like he was my friend.
Can I?
To remember you?
No shouting, but we still need a name for this Little guy.
How about Ben?
I Like Ben.
Ben.
Ben's good.
How come you never mentioned Ben before?
We just cooked it up.
That's what we were off doing.
Can we come in?
Yeah, come on.
Come on.
I know.
I know.
Everybody, there's someone I'd Like you to meet.
This is Ben.
Hi, Ben.
Ben, this is everybody.
Susan, he looks just Like you.
Thanks.
Oh, God!
I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
I know.
I still am one of these.
Can I?
Okay, the head.
You gotta.
I'm your Aunt Monica!
Yes, I am!
I'm your Aunt Monica!
I will always have gum.
Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around.
Like this.
But I'II still always come back.
Like this.
And sometimes, I may be away longer.
Like this.
But I'II still always come back.
Like this.
And sometimes, I'II want you to steal third and I'II go Like this.
He is so amazing!
Yeah, I know.
Look at him!
Nothing.
I don't think that's his name.
Look, he's closing his eyes.
Look, he's opening his eyes.
He doesn't do much, does he?
Nope, this is pretty much it.
You guys wanna get some coffee?
I'II see you guys later.
Look, he's closing his eyes again
But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
What a great gift!
Is "The Way You Look Tonight" on it?
We'll have to listen and see.
Oh, I love it!
Thank you so much.
You ready to open yours?
It's a sock bunny.
Remember how I call you bunny?
Not really.
I did one time.
And I want to start doing it more.
That's what this is about.
I see.
Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
No, she doesn't.
What she makes, they're sock rabbits.
They're completely different.
Okay, okay.
I didn't make it!
I forgot about tonight and that we're supposed to make the presents.
It's okay.
No, it's not okay.
You're so incredible.
You went through all this time and effort to make this tape.
I'll make this up to you.
I will.
I am going to cook you anything you want in here.
And I'm going to do anything you want in there.
Well, I did put a lot of thought into the tape.
You are way too young to have seen that.
Your birthday's in a month and a half.
What if I forget to get you a present for that too?
You are totally and completely 100 percent forgiven.
We've got to wash that.
Remember that jacket you loved that was too expensive?
You have done enough.
I'll wake up early and get it.
No, you don't.. Get it in black, not brown.
Your cake is ready.
Oh, my good God.
Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals.
Tonight, number three: Macaroni and cheese with cutup hot dogs.
Look, you have done enough.
You have to stop this now.
I will, but not tonight.
For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape that you made me.
Oh, the mixed tape.
"The Way You Look Tonight" is on here.
Dance with me.
You are just the sweetest.
I love the way you look every night, Chandler.
That's why I made you this tape.
Happy birthday!
That's a no.
I am so, so, so, so sorry.
And I will cook anything you want in here... and do anything you want in there.
Yeah, you will!
And are you kidding me?
Come on, Monica, it's our Valentine's Day.
Please, please, please, please?
Okay.
So are we going in there?
I am!
Nowhere to run.
I don't like sitting up here.
We should help them.
I don't think they need any help
That Porsche guy took his car back.
But you found the keys to his clothes?
No, I just love the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
They'll think you own one because of the clothes?
Of course.
Only an idiot would wear this stuff if he didn't have the car.
That is true.
Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Oh, I've been there.
I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
You know you don't actually have one.
What are you doing?
I'm in character.
Will you talk to her?
I think it just moved.
It's poking me.
We'll go to the emergency room.
No, you can't leave me here with them.
We're babysitting.
The babies are asleep.
You'll be okay on your own.
You can't leave me with them.
We're a team.
We're playing a zone.
They'll tripleteam me!
He's got plastic in his throat.
We gotta go to the hospital.
But a doctor won't be able to help him.
And it's just gonna... naturally pass through his system in seven years.
I think that's gum.
I'm pretty sure it's gun.
This really hurts.
Let's go.
But no!
A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital.
No!
What would Krog do?
How are the Gellers?
Don't call us that.
The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment.
Now we gotta get a divorce!
Did a Porsche throw up on you?
It's "Porschea"!
Me taking care of you is no problem, huh?
You guys feel safe, right?
I'm gonna take that spit bubble as a "Yeah, I do!"
Let's get rid of this dirty diaper.
I'll set you up with a clean one.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
I just have to clean that up.
Because, let's face it, we're at Monica's.
I broke it.
All right.
Well, that's just the way things go.
Okay.
Good.
Why are there only two of you?
Where's Leslie?
Well, you can't answer.
Leslie?
Where are you, Leslie?
Now would be a good time for your first words.
Well, look at you!
You are a little bit mischievous.
My gosh!
Oh, you're a lot mischievous.
Well, it'll dry.
You sit with your brother and sister now... who aren't there.
How do you feel?
Let's just say Krog will be equipped to destroy the universe again... in 12 to 14 hours.
I totally took care of the babies all by myself.
I fed them, bathed them and put them to bed.
And protected them from a tornado?
Oh, my God!
I know.
The babies are asleep.
Phoebe, what happened here?
I did it.
I took care of the babies all by myself.
But my apartment!
Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
But the mess!
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies.
No, it was on the house.
It was a newlywed special.
That may be the most depressing thing I've heard.
Careful around my Porsche!
Hi, Joey.
Hey.
How you doing?
He has the most amazing Porsche under there.
I'd show you, but I just tucked her in.
She's sleeping.
Would you like to go for a drink
In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you.
You know, this is just..
This is classic Rachel.
Oh, yeah, right.
Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby?
This might be my one chance to have a child, Rachel.
I mean, you know that I have been so busy focusing on my career..    What career?
I'm a decorator.
You decorate Dad's office and now you're a decorator?
Okay, I went to the zoo yesterday, now I'm a koala bear.
Why can't you ever be supportive?
You wanna talk supportive?
You didn't come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby!
You didn't come see me in the hospital when I was getting my lips done!
I did the first time.
You know what?
You wanna know why I am not giving Emily to you?
Emma.
Whose side are you on?!
I'm not giving you Emma because you can't handle the responsibility of a child.
Well, how hard could it be?
You do it.
You wanna know why you don't want me to have the baby?
Because you don't want me to be happy.
You have always been jealous of me.
Jealous of what?
Of your lack of responsibility?
Your immaturity?
Your total disregard for other people's feelings?
To name a few.
You've always been like this.
You had to have everything, and I couldn't have anything.
Like in junior high, when you stole Timmy from me.
I mean, do you even realize how much that hurt me?
Timmy was my boyfriend, and you made out with him!
Come on, that was 20 years ago.
Get over it.
Yeah, well, you know what I cannot believe?
That my socalled sister..   gets a 30 percent discount from Ralph Lauren, and I still have to pay retail?
It's 45.
You bitch.
You just think you're so perfect..   with your new baby and your small apartment.
Well, let me tell you something.
Your baby isn't even that cute.
Too far, Amy.
Too far.
You take that back.
No.
Take it back!
No.
What are you gonna do?
Make me?
Hey, man, I work out!
So do I.  I do Pilates.
I do yoga.
Bring it on!
Put the plates in the boxes!
Put the plates in the boxes!
Did you just push me?
Yeah, I think I did.
All right, that's it.
Are you out of your mind?
Let's throw some JellO on them!
This is our apartment, and you cannot behave this way!
If you can't act your age, you shouldn't be here at all.
Those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones that I picked out..   but they're important to Monica.
And I want you to apologize to her, now.
I'm sorry.
Mon, I'm so sorry.
Okay.
That's better.
Now, I want you to apologize to each other and mean it.
Sorry.
Sorry.
By the way, that fight was totally arousing.
Dude, well done.
If I die and Rachel dies and Monica dies, you can totally take care of Emma.
Yeah?
Well, thanks.
So..
So now do I get Joey?
Okay.
But you should know he eats a lot and shoves pennies up his nose.
Look, Amy..   we got a little..   a little outofcontrol over there.
Ross, hi.
It's me.
I just got back on the plane.
And I just feel awful.
That is so not how I wanted  things to end with us.
It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you,  and all of a sudden you're there  and saying these things... And... And now I'm just sitting  here and thinking of all the stuff  I should have said, and I didn't.
I mean, I didn't even get to  tell you that I love you too.
Because of course I do.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you... What am I doing?
I love you!
Oh, I've gotta see you.
I've gotta get off this plane.
Oh my God!
Excuse me?
Miss?
Please, sit down!
I'm really sorry, but  I need to get off the plane, okay?
I need to tell someone  that I love love them.
Miss, I can't let you  off the plane.
Let her off the plane!
I am afraid you are gonna  have to take a seat.
Oh, please, miss, you don't understand!
/  Try to understand!
Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off...  No!
No!
Oh my God.
Did she get off the plane?
Did she get off the plane?
I got off the plane.
You got off the plane.
I do love you.
I love you too, and I'm never  letting you go again.
Okay.
'Cause this is where I  wanna be, okay?
No more messing  around.
I don't wanna mess this up again.
Me neither, okay?
We are  we're done being stupid.
Okay.
You and me, alright?
This is it.
This is it.
Unless we're on a break....   Don't make jokes now.
But more important, because of  rent control, it was a friggin' steal!
Not yet, not yet, not yet!
Hello, Chip.
How you doing?
I'm great!
Got a great job.
I have wonderful friends.
Though I'm not seeing anyone now, I've never felt better about myself.
So, Monica ready yet?
She'll be out in a second.
So, Chip, how's Amy Welsh?
Amy Welsh?
I haven't seen her since So, Monica about ready?
Wow, you look great.
This is the unit for you.
Sturdy construction, tons of storage.
Some big enough to fit a grown man.
What?
Yeah, I got in there myself once.
My roommate bet me $5 I couldn't.
Then he stuck a board through the handles and locked me in.
It was funny till I felt like it was a coffin.
No, you can't fit in there.
It's not deep enough.
Oh, yeah?
If I can't...
...I'll knock $5 off the price.
All right, you have yourself a deal.
See?
I told you.
Sometimes I come in here just to get away from it.
Hey, a nickel!
Here we are.
You still have the Chipper!
The what?
That's what we called your motorcycle in high school.
A motorcycle's a chopper.
And you're Chip.
Never mind.
I think it's cute.
A lipper from Chipper.
Are you still in touch with anyone?
There's Rachel... ...and that's it.
How about you?
I still hang with Simens and Zana.
I see Spindler, Levine, Kelly.
I run into Goldie...
...Stick, Brown, Sulkov, McGuire...
...J.T., Beardsley.
Is that all?
After high school, you kind of lose touch.
I ran into Richard Dorfman.
How is he?
Me and Simens gave him a wedgie.
Isn't he an architect?
They still wear underwear.
Oh, my God!
What?
Are you all right?
What happened?
Oh, man, he promised he wouldn't take the chairs!
How were you locked in?
Where the hell is all of our stuff?
This guy came by to look at the unit... ...and he said it won't fit a grown man.
So you got in voluntarily?
I was trying to make a sale!
If I ever run into him, you know what I'll do?
Bend over?
And then Zana just let one rip!
Not that I don't enjoy talking about high school... ...because I do.
Maybe we can talk about something else.
I don't know where you work.
You know where I work.
I do?
The movie theater.
You used to come in all the time.
Still at the Multiplex?
Like I'd give up that job!
Free popcorn and candy anytime I want?
I can get you posters.
Told me he just went out with Leslie Maskin.
Got to third base.
Do you still live with your parents?
Yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
Why couldn't he have been a kidnapper.
Where are they?
Where are they?
This is nice.
We never do anything, just the two of us.
That's great.
Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car, run over some puppies.
I don't wanna do that.
Here we go.
Have a good breakup.
Hey, Janice.
My God, I am so glad you called me.
I had the most supremely awful day.
That's not good.
Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
We got the proofs from that photo shoot with the vegetables.
They sucked.
I blew off the rest of the afternoon.
I went shopping.
And I got you.
I'm looking.
I'm looking.
I'm looking.
I got you.
What?
What?
What did you get me there?
I got you these.
Bullwinkle socks.
That's so sweet.
I knew you had the Rockys.
So you could wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle or wear Rocky and Rocky, or you can mix and match.
Moose and squirrel.
Whatever you want.
I'm gonna get another espresso.
More latte?
No, I'm still working on mine.
That's it?
Yeah, it was really hard.
The hug looked pretty brutal.
You weren't there.
You can do this.
It's like pulling off a BandAid.
Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
Go!
Go!
Hi, Janice.
I don't think we should go out anymore.
All right.
Well, there you go.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this.
It's like we're different.
I'm the bing, bing, bing.
You're the boom, boom, boom.
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry!
Are you okay?
It's just my lens.
It's my lens.
I'll be right back.
I hit her in the eye!
I hit her in the eye!
This is the worst breakup in the history of the world!
Oh, my God!
How many have you had?
I don't know.
A million!
Chandler, easy, easy.
Go to your happy place.
I'm fine, I'm fine.
All right.
I'm not fine.
Here she comes.
Wait here, okay?
Breathe.
How do you do that?
It's like a gift.
We should always break up together.
I'd like that!
You were incredible.
Home sweet home, huh?
Nice to get back to reality.
Plus, we know how the New Year's gonna go off.
I guess there's no reason for all that Y2K panic, you know?
Anyway, good night.
Joey?
Yeah?
Three... two, one.
Happy New Year.
What was that for?
Tonight when they yelled "cut" and we didn't get to kiss...
I was really, really disappointed, and I just...
I just really wanted to kiss you.
Really?
In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too.
In the moment.
In the moment.
But only in the moment.
So do you want to kiss again?
Sure.
New Year's Eve is only two weeks away.
Can you wait?
No.
Me neither.
Three, two... You don't have to count down every time we kiss.
Oh.
Okay.
Except I sort of felt like I needed a couple seconds to get ready.
We were on the platform, ready to dance into the new millennium... and the guy yells, "Cut!"
So you guys are telling me that you actually did... the routine from eighth grade?
Yeah!
But of course we had to update it a little bit.
Hey, by the way, quick thinking about catching me.
There's no way you could've done the end... the way you guys did it back then.
What?
We could do it.
I don't know.
You were a lot bigger..
I mean, stronger back then.
I can do it, okay?
Come on, let's go!
Come on.
One, two, three, four... five, six, seven, eight.
I can't do it!
Now, you do that, you're on TV
Anybody want to meet a hero?
John Glenn is here?
No.
Joey.
Joey's never been in outer space.
We had the most incredible night.
We're in the car Wait.
Hold on.
Hi.
Hi.
Okay, go ahead.
So we're in the car, and bang!
A shot was fired.
And Joey, with no regard for his own safety... ...throws himself on me.
My God!
It was a car backfire.
But he didn't know that.
Yeah, I didn't know that.
It could just as easily have been a bullet.
Ever think about joining the force?
We could use a guy like you.
Who jumps at loud noises.
Wow.
I could have died tonight.
Yeah, if the car that backfired had run over you!
I'm gonna go home, before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
I do have a newfound respect for life.
Oh, my God!
You want to get some dinner?
Sure.
You know what?
If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
Maybe we should walk in a bad neighborhood.
Okay.
Bye.
Cut it out.
I'd hate to save your life and kick your ass on the same day.
Why'd you take off?
Just going for a walk.
Around the living room, whatever.
Is something wrong?
No.
No, I'm just tired.
You know, from the walk.
You dove in front of Ross!
Ross!
That's what this is about.
Oh, my God.
You hate Ross!
I don't hate Ross.
Of course you do.
I saved him.
You're mad at me.
It adds up.
You want Ross out of the picture.
What picture?
I don't know.
But I don't like what I'm hearing.
I'm glad you saved Ross in the car backfire.
But it could've been a bullet.
And you didn't try to save me.
You're upset because you think I chose Ross over you.
No, I knew you could take care of yourself.
You know?
I mean, Ross needs help.
He's not "street" like us.
You'd risk your life for Ross before you would for me.
That's the bottom line.
No, not exactly.
All right, look.
I wasn't trying to save Ross.
Okay?
My sandwich was next to Ross.
All right?
I was trying to save my sandwich.
From a bullet?
I know it doesn't make much sense.
"Much" sense?
Look, it was instinct!
I just went for it.
You risked your life for a sandwich?
I know it sounds crazy... ...but this is the greatest sandwich in the world!
So you didn't choose Ross before me?
No.
I would never do that.
You're like my brother.
Really?
Yeah.
In fact, to prove how much you mean to me...
Here.
Thanks.
Easy, it's not a hot dog!
How good is that?
See?
What are you doing?
You're showing me how much I mean to you.
With a bite.
Jeez!
What are you doing here?
Chandler, you have the best taste in men.
Like father, like son.
Patrick and I had such a great time last night!
This could, maybe, get serious.
I thought you weren't looking for serious.
Just a fling?
Well, you know, possibly.
You didn't tell him that, though, right?
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?
You don't tell him that!
Why not?
I'd be thrilled if some hot girl I see.
You telling him I want a fling and me putting out... ...he's so going to get the wrong idea!
Patrick just ended things with me.
Did you or didn't you tell him I wanted a serious relationship?
I did!
I absolutely did!
You idiot!
I'm sure you're right.
But why?
You don't tell a guy that you want a serious relationship.
Now you scared him away!
I am sorry.
I am so sorry.
You should never be allowed to talk to people!
I know, I know!
Now I'm right back where I started.
This sucks!
Being alone sucks!
You'll meet somebody.
You're a great catch!
When I told those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once.
Really?
You graduated magna cum laude, right?
It doesn't matter.
I got tickets to the Ranger game.
You want to come with me?
Cute guys in little shorts?
Sure.
Actually, it's a hockey team.
Angry Canadians with no teeth.
That sounds fun too.
Thank you.
Okay.
Have you ever been with a woman?
What?
What is the matter with you?
There is no good time to ask that question.
The station is Poughkeepsie.
Went to the store Sat on Santa's lap Asked him to bring my friends All kinds of crap Said all you need is To write them a song Now you haven't heard it yet So don't try to sing along No, don't sing along Monica, Monica Have a happy Hannukah Saw Santa Claus He said hello to Ross And please tell Joey Christmas will be snowy And Rachel and Chandler Happy holidays, everybody

Get a room I would get a room with this cake I think I show this cake a good time.
If you had to, what would you give up food or sex?
Sex.
Seriously, answer faster.
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
No, when she said sex, I wasn't thinking about sex with you.
It's like a giant hug.
Ross, how about you?Which would you give upsex or food?
Food.
OK, uh, How about sex or dinosaurs?
Oh, my god.
It's like sophie's choice.
What about you, Joe?What would you give up sex or food?
Uh... ooh... uh.
I don't know.
It's too hard.
No, you gotta pick one.

Food.
Sex.
Food.
Se...
I don't know.
Oh, god, I want both.I want...
I want girls on bread.
Okay, you've got to see these latest pictures of Emma.
You're supposed to wear a costume.I am.
I am a woman who spent moneyon a dress she wants to wear..   because soon she won'tfit into it.
I'm Catwoman, who wants the dresswhen you're too big for it.
Trick or treat!Can I give out candy?
I want to be with kids.
Since I gotpregnant, I have maternal instincts.
Trick or treat!Just a minute!
Look at you guys!
Wow!
You are a very scary witch.Thank you.
And you are a very funny clown.Thank you.
And you..   are so in style right now.
I work at Ralph Lauren.
The fall linehas got this equestrian theme.
Did you see the cover of Vogue..?Could I just have the candy?
Sure.
Catwoman.
So we meet again.
So we do, Supergirl.
It's me, Phoebe.
Monica, can I talk to youfor a second?
I appreciate the costume.
You did this to him?
I thought he'd love it.
He loves The Velveteen Rabbit.That rabbit was brown and white.
It was pink, or no bunny at all.
No bunny at all.Always no bunny at all!
You didn't dress up either?Yes, I did.
I'm Chandler.
Dude, what happened?
How is that me?
I'm Chandler.
That is so you!
When have I ever done that?When have I ever done that?
Trick or treat.
You're the prettiest ballerina ever.Thank you.
That deserves another candy.
Thank you.
I have to say,that earns "twotwo" pieces of candy.
I love you!
Honey, here, take it all.
Monica?
We need more candy.
There's only been four kids.I know.
But one said she loved me,so I gave her everything.
No wonder you're pregnant.
What are you supposed to be?Remember the satellite, Sputnik?
Well, I'm a potato.
Or a "spud"..   and these are my antenna.
So Sputnik becomes..?
Spudnik!
Wow!
I don't havethe worst costume anymore.
All right!
Ross came as doodie.
Trick or treat.
Know what?
We're out of candy.But someone went for more.
And I've been giving out money,but I'm out of that too.
Can I write you a check?Okay.
Okay.
What's your name?Lelani Mayolanofavich.
Okay, I'm just gonna write this outto "cash."
Hi.Hi, Mona.
Joey's gonna be thrilled.
He washoping you'd be a slutty nurse.
Actually, I'm just a nurse.
You'd think that would embarrass me,but I'm maxed out.
You made it.Wait.
You're a potato?Well, I'm a spud..?
And the antenna.. You're Spudnik!Yes!
Marry her.
You wanted to see me?
Yeah.
Here's a box of your stuff.
What?
You know, it's just, like, hats... ...and a shirt and CDs.
Just sort of stuff that you've left here.
What are you doing?
Are you trying to hurt me or something?
No.
Ross, it...
It just seems that, you know, it's time we, you know, move on.
I mean, don't you think?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes, I do.
Good.
Yeah, I really do.
Hey!
This was a gift.
Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
It's still a gift.
I got it from the gift shop.
Okay!
All right!
Give me the mug!
I'll keep the mug!
No!
You know what, don't do me any favors.
In fact... ...where's the rest of my stuff?
Like my...
This book is mine!
And that Tshirt you sleep in?
I'd like that back too.
Yes, I do.
You know how much I love that Tshirt.
You never even wear that Tshirt.
I'm just trying to help you move on.
Oh, you are a petty man.
You are a petty, petty...
Petty... ...petty, petty... ...small... ...small... You are so just doing this out of spite.
No.
No.
No.
I'm gonna wear this all the time!
I love this shirt!
You have not worn that Tshirt since you were 15!
It doesn't even fit you anymore!
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, okay.
Okay!
Now, if you don't mind, I'm gonna take the rest of my stuff... ...and relax... ...in my favorite shirt.
You have a pleasant evening.
So you're, like, a zillionaire.
Hey.
Why isn't it "Spiderman"?
You know?
Like Goldman, Silverman?
Because it's not his last name.
It isn't?
No.
It's not, like... ...like, Phil Spiderman.
He's a spider... ...man.
You know, like, Goldman is a last name.
But there's no Gold Man.
Okay.
There should be a Gold Man!
Hey.
Hey, Rach.
How was work?
Oh, it was great.
Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
Oh.
Well, I guess I had that one coming.
I'm just gonna throw it out.
It's probably just shampoo and... Something wrong?
No.
Nothing.
So, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
Okay.
Well, he would turn things to gold.
What about things that are already gold?
His work is done.
Okay.
Let's play my game now.
Okay.
All right, you yellowbellied, lilylivered...
Draw
Potatoes are ruined!
Potatoes are ruined!
Potatoes are ruined!
Here we come Walking down the.
This doesn't smell like Mom's.
It doesn't, does it?
But you wanted lumps.
Well, here you go, buddy.
You got one!
God, this is great!
The plane is gone, so I guess I'm stuck here with you guys.
We all had better plans, okay?
This was nobody's first choice!
Oh, really?
So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious dinner?
Now, this feels like Thanksgiving.
What?
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven.
Oh, my God!
He's not alone.
Ugly Naked Guy is having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
I gotta see this!
All right, Ugly Naked Guy!
Ugly naked dancing!
It's nice that he has someone.
Shall I carve?
By all means.
Who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
I don't even want to know about the dark cheese.
Does anybody want to split this?
I will.
You guys have to make a wish.
Make a wish?
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.
You got the bigger half!
What did you wish for?
The bigger half.
All right, I'd like to propose a toast.
A little toast here.
Ding, ding!
This isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving you planned but for me this has been really great.
I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
If you had gone to Vail or if you had been with your family, or if you didn't have syphilis and stuff we wouldn't be all together.
So I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
That's so sweet!
Thank you.
Here's to a lousy Christmas!
And a crappy New Year
An added pinch of saffron makes all the difference.
Monica?
Yes?
Yes, she is.
This is my friend, Rachel.
Hi, I'm Dr. Mitchell.
And I'm his friend, Dr. Rosen.
Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
Excuse me?
God, young, young.
I meant young.
Young to be a doctor.
Good, Rach.
Thank you.
Rachel, the cute doctors are here!
Okay, coming.
Hi, come on in.
Hey, Michael, Jeffrey.
We brought wine.
Look at this.
It's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine.
How could we resist?
That's great!
So, Monica, how's the ankle?
It's.
Why don't you tell them?
After all, it is your ankle.
It's feeling a lot better.
Thank you.
Why don't you guys sit down, and we'll get you some glasses.
Stat!
Listen, why don't we just tell them who we really are?
I think it'll be fine.
It will not.
We'll get in trouble.
Would you stop being such a wuss!
A wuss?
Excuse me for living in the real world.
So?
So they still seem normal.
Because they are.
When we go out with women we meet at the hospital.
Would you relax?
Take a look around.
There are no pagan altars.
No piles of bones in the corners.
They're fine.
Go like this: We are not going to do it, okay?
Sometimes you can be such a big baby!
I am not a baby.
Be serious.
You get uptight.
You act like a princess.
You know what?
You know what?
Every day you are becoming more and more like your mother.
Excuse me.
Here we go.
This is a great place.
How long have you lived here?
Thanks.
I've been here about six years.
And Rachel moved in a few months ago.
See, I was supposed to get married but I left the guy at the altar.
Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but hey, that's me!
Why don't you try the hummus?
Monica, what do you do?
I am a chef at a restaurant uptown.
Good for you.
Yeah, it is.
Mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
Well, this hummus is great.
God bless the chickpea.
Oh, God!
I am so spoiled!
That's it.
And have I mentioned that back in high school I was a cow?
I used to wet my bed.
I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
We both do that!
Monica and Rachel's apartment.
Just one second.
Rachel, it's your dad.
Hi, Dad.
No, no.
It's me.
Listen, Dad, I can't talk right now.
But there's something.
There's something I've been meaning to tell you.
Excuse me.
Remember back in freshman year?
Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
Why would I sleep with Billy Dreskin?
Come on, cut it out!
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
What?
Come on, talk to me.
What's the longest you've been in a relationship before... ...having the sex?
Why?
Who's not?
Are you and Julie not?
Are you and Julie not having sex?
Technically?
No.
Is it because she's so cold in bed?
Or because she's kind of bossy, makes it feel like school?
No!
She's great.
And it's not like we haven't done anything.
We do plenty of other stuff.
Lots of other stuff like No!
Don't need to know the details.
No, it's just...
It's me.
I've only been with one woman my whole life... ...and she turned out to be a lesbian.
So now I've got myself all psyched out.
It's become, like, this... ...this thing!
You must just think I'm weird.
No, I don't think it's weird.
I think, in fact...
In fact, you know what I think?
What?
I think it's sexy.
Sexy?
Let me tell you something.
As a woman... ...there is nothing sexier... ...than a man who does not want to have sex.
No kidding?
You know what I'd do?
I'd wait.
You'd wait?
Absolutely.
I would wait... ...and wait... Then I'd wait some more.
Really?
I don't care if she tells you she wants it, she begs, she pleads... ...she tells you she's gonna have sex with another man That just means it's working.
Women really want this?
More than jewelry.
Look at you!
You look great!
I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable.
And now I'm actually happy.
You know, I mean really happy.
I just don't wanna...
I don't wanna mess it up, you know?
I know.
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.
Right.
Maybe it doesn't have to be this tough.
Maybe you were on the right track with that whole "spontaneous" thing.
Women really like that.
Really?
I mean if it were me, I'd want you to...
I don't know, catch me off guard with a really... ...good kiss.
Really sort of soft at first.
And then maybe brush the hair away from my face.
And then look far into my eyes... ...in a way that lets me know something... ...amazing is about to happen.
And then, I don't know, then... ...you'd pull me really close to you so that... ...so that I'd be pressed up right against you.
And it would get kind of... ...sweaty... ...and blurry.
And then it's just happening.
Thanks, Rach.
Good night!
Oh, God!
Good morning!
Well, somebody got some last night!
So how did you guys meet?
Well, I was in Mrs. Knight's...
I mean, Alice.
Sorry, Alice.
I always do that.
I was in her homeec class.
He was my best student.
Yeah.
She was my best teacher.
If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?
And so now you guys are gonna be married?
Yeah.
We talked about just living together... ...but we want kids right away.
Oh, my God!
Great!
Kids.
Frank, are you sure you're ready for that?
How hard can it be?
You know, I mean, it's babies.
Who doesn't want babies?
Right?
And besides, I never had a dad around.
And now I always will, because it'll be me.
Yeah.
Right?
Really, we do realize that there's an age difference between us.
Good.
Because you were acting like you didn't.
Oh, no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?
You are falling fast asleep.
All we're saying is, don't rush into anything.
Come on, think about it.
You're 18, okay?
She's 44.
When you're 36, she's gonna be 88.
What?
You don't think I know that?
The point is... ...there's a lot of women you haven't had sex with yet.
He's right.
He's right.
This is your time.
You're young.
You're weird.
Chicks dig that.
Isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really care about?
Yeah, in a poem, maybe.
No, the man's right.
That's what I had with Rachel.
You don't have it anymore?
No.
I slept with someone else.
So wait.
So how did that make things better?
It didn't.
What you used to have with Rachel is what I got with Alice.
Now, what is that like?
It's so cool, man.
It's because being with her is so much better than not being with her.
Why can't I find that?
I had it and I blew it.
Well, I want it!
You can have it.
Maybe there's something wrong with me.
No, it's out there, man.
I've seen it!
I got it!
Then, you hold on to it!
All right, man!
All right!
Congratulations, you lucky bastard!
You're Frank's best man?
I couldn't help it.
Their love is so pure.
What about you, huh?
I'm the ring bearer.
Hi, Frank.
Hi, Mrs. Knight.
Phoebe's right, Frank.
It's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it.
I was being selfish.
Even though we want the same things right now... ...in the future, we may not.
Is that what it is?
Yes, but not just that.
Not just that.
Even though we love each other as much as we do... ...nonetheless...
Nonetheless.
Nonetheless.
You're too young... ...to really know what you want.
That's right, exactly.
All right, that's a goodbye kiss.
That's good.
Byebye.
But no, the important thing is, is that you see what I'm saying.
This is clearly wrong.
I've decided I'm gonna let this happen.
Okay, can I just get my purse?
I'm sorry.
Okay, all right, good.
So your dad dropped by.
He's a pleasant man.
Oh, no.I better go.
Just over here.I don't wanna miss the fight.
Ross, I am so sorry.
I promise, I will straighten this outwith him tomorrow, in person.
Or via email.
I don't care about your dad.
I care aboutMona.
She was there and she's freaked out!
Okay, I'll fix that too.What's her email address?
All right, I promise, I'll fix this.I swear.
I'll talk to her.
Okay.
Thank you.
That's it?You call that a fight?
"We were on a break!"
Thank you so muchfor coming back over.
Oh, good.
You're here.
And I was worried thatit was going to be uncomfortable.
No, Mona, just hear me out.
First of all, I am so sorryabout my father yelling at you.
But I heard that you held your own.You have to tell me how you did that.
Focus.Okay.
Yes, Ross and I used to date.
And yes, we are gonna have a baby.
But we are definitely notgetting back together.
How can I be sure of that?Because we drove each other crazy.
He was possessive, he was jealous.He could never just let the little things go.
Trying to date this woman.
None of that comparedto how kind and gentle..   and thoughtful he is.
You probably shouldn't touch me.
I don't wanna get in the middleof something so complicated.
I get it, but, Mona, what relationshipis not complicated?
We all have our baggage.You must too.
Why else would you still be single?
I'm so gonna leave right now.
Should I leave this open?
I'm not sure yet.
Why didn't youjust tell me about all this?
Because what's going on has nothing to dowith how I feel about you.
You still should have told me.I know, and I was going to..   but I thought it was betterthat you heard it from Rachel's father.
I made a mistake..   but it's only becauseI really, really like you.
Really.
Okay.
I guess you canclose the door now.
Forgot my purse.Oh, you guys made up.
He's a good kisser, isn't he?I'm going!
I promised you a stripper..   and you're gonna get a stripper.
Monica, wait.What?
Carry on.
These tennis shoes are so tight.
I think I'll take them off.Could you not narrate?
Gotcha, sailor.
Just becauseyou're not in love with the guy..   You told your dad the truth.About an hour ago.
Wanna go see a movie?Yes.
Bye, Dad.
It's unacceptable!
What the hell does lovehave to do with it?
Hey, I do think aboutthe consequences of my decisions!
Well, what gives you the right to..?
Go to hell!
Stupid guy on my phone

Yes, we were.
Yes, we were.
Come here, gorgeous.
Look at you.
You are the cutest little baby ever.
You're just a littlebitty baby, you know that?
But you've got..   You've got big, beautiful eyes.
Yes, you do.
And a.. And a big, round belly.
Big baby butt.
I like big butts.
Oh, my God, Emma.
You're laughing.
Oh, my God.
You've never done that before, have you?
You've never done that before.
Daddy made you laugh, huh?
Well, Daddy and Sir MixALot.
What?
What?
You wanna hear some more?
I'm a terrible father.
Listen.
I just got Phoebe all dressed to meet Mike's parents.
She's so nervous.
It's so sweet.
Guess what.
I made Emma laugh today.
You what?
And I missed it..   because I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?!
Yeah, and it was like a real little person laugh too.
It was like:   Only not creepy.
What did you do to make her laugh?
I..   Well, I sang.
Actually..
I rapped..   "Baby Got Back."
You what?
You sang to our baby daughter..   a song about a guy who likes to have sex..   with women with giant asses?
You know what, if you think about it..   it actually promotes a healthy body image..   because even big butts..   or "juicy doubles" are..
Please don't take her away from me.
All right, sweetheart.
This is only because I love you so much.
And I know that you're not gonna tell anybody.
Emma, you're laughing!
You are!
You really do like big butts, don't you?
You beautiful little weirdo.
You missed it!
She was laughing!
It was amazing.
It was amazing.
It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound.
I know, isn't it?
What'd you do to get her to laugh?
You know, I just.. A couple of things I tried.
Different..   Just sang a little "The ItsyBitsy Spider."
You sang "Baby Got Back," didn't you?
It was really topdrawer.
I'm a little warm, so I'm gonna be taking off my sweater.
Now, I'm just letting you know... ...this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
Yep, that's hilarious.
I'm sorry.
I'm done.
I'm done.
You know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
No, not really.
You've seen me naked hundreds of times.
But I just don't embarrass that easily.
What?
You totally get embarrassed.
No, I don't.
Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
Is that so?
Yeah.
Hey, lady!
I don't care how much you want it, okay?
I am not gonna have sex with you in the bathroom!
You know, in Roman times, this was more than just a hat.
So I'm on my way back to the bathroom.
All right, all right.
Just keep walking, all right?
What are you?
I am sorry, sir.
I think he just really likes you.
You know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
Can I help you?
Okay
I'm so sorry, you guys.
I didn't mean to bring you down.
No, you were right.
I don't have a plan.
Pizza guy!
Thank God.
Food!
Phoebe?
What?
Do you have a plan?
I don't even have a "pla. "
One mushroom, green pepper and onion?
That's not what we ordered!
We ordered a fatfree crust with extra cheese!
Wait.
You're not G. Stephanopolous?
Oh, man.
My dad's gonna kill me!
Wait!
Did you say G. Stephanopolous?
It goes across the street.
I gave him yours.
Bonehead!
Bonehead!
Was this a small Mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
That sounds about right.
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
And a power tie?
No, pretty much just a towel.
Oh, God!
Want me to take this back?
Are you nuts?
We've got George Stephanopolous' pizza!
Who's George Snuffleupagus?
That's Big Bird's friend.
I see pizza!
I wanna see.
Let me see.
Hello!
Who are we spying on?
You know, the White House adviser?
Clinton's campaign guy.
The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt.
Oh, him!
The little guy.
Oh, I love him!
Wait.
Wait, I see a woman.
Tell me it's his mother.
Definitely not his mother.
Oh, no!
She's walking across the floor.
She's walking, she's walking.
She's going for the pizza.
Hey, that's not for you, bitch!
Okay, I got one.
Do you remember that vegetarian that I made that you loved so much?
Well, unless goose is a vegetable!
Okay, fine.
Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
What?
You slept with Jason?
You'd already broken up.
How long?
A couple hours.
Oh, that's nice!
Okay, okay, I got one!
Anyway.
The valentine Tom left in your locker was really from me!
Excuse me?
Hello!
Like he was really gonna send you one.
She was a big girl!
Really?
Well, at least big girls don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
I was laughing.
You made me laugh!
Oh, my God!
There he is!
There he is!
Where?
Where we've been looking all night.
Oh, he's so cute.
George, baby, drop the towel.
Come on, drop the towel.
Man, can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
Yes, how about it.
Come here.
Give me my puck.
No roughhousing in my ER!
Right foot, red.
Could've played Monopoly, but no!
Thanks.
Right hand, blue.
Good.
It's the VISAcard people.
Will you take my place?
All right.
Yes, this is Rachel.
No, I know.
I haven't been using it much.
Well, thanks.
But I'm okay, really.
To the green.
I've got magic beans.
No, never mind.
To the left!
To the left!
I'm fine
So are you ready to talk about it?
No.
Now?
No!
We'll talk about something else then.Thank you.
Who's the father?
Honey, I haven't told him yet..   so, until I do, I don't thinkI should tell anybody else.
That's fine.
That's fair.
Is it Tag?Phoebe!
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'll stop.
Is it Ross?
It's Ross, isn't it?
Oh, my God, it's Joey!Stop it.
Okay?
I am not gonna tell youuntil I tell him.
At least we know it's a him.
Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?Let's not talk about that right now.
This is so huge.Sure, but as big as your wedding?
Of course not.
Nothing is.
Between me and you,in this day and age..   how dumb do you have to beto get pregnant?
Sometimes you can do everything right.Everyone wears what they're supposed to..   and one of those little guysjust gets through.
How?I don't know.
Maybe they have tools.
Well, I talked to her, and she'sdefinitely gonna have the baby.
She said she's gonnaraise it on her own.
Well, maybe that's really brave.Maybe.
I just hope she realizes how hardit's gonna be.
Maybe she hasn't really thought itthrough that much.
Well, there's a lot to think about.
How is she gonna handle this financially?How is she gonna juggle work?
Does she realize she's not gonna havea date again for the next, like, 18 years?
I don't know.
Are you okay?
I'm just thinking about Phoebe.Poor, knockedup Phoebe.
Champagne?Oh, yes!
Thank you very much.
That's actually how the French drink it.
Well, I just got off the phonewith my lover James Brolin.
Oh, really?Apparently, he is married to some singer.
But he said he'd leave her for me.And I said, "James Brolin, are you sure?"
James Brolin said..Rachel's the one who's pregnant?
What?!
Why bother?
How do you feel?I don't know how I feel.
This is all happening so fast.
I have to makeall these decisions that I don't wanna make.
Someone just take this away from me!
Calm down.
Maybe you're not pregnant.What?!
When I got pregnant with the triplets,I took that test, like, three times.
Yes.
Maybe it's a false positive.Are you sure you peed on the stick right?
How many ways are there to do that?
I'm just saying, don't freak outuntil you're 100 percent sure.
All right, I'll take it againwhen I get home.
I can wait until then.
Do it as a present to me.
Okay, thank you.
I'll run out and get you one.You girls are so great.
Wait a minute.
Who's the father?She won't tell us.
Come on!
It's my wedding.That could be my present!
I just gave you peeing on a stick.See, this is why you register.
It was the chair again.
How can I be upsetover something I never had?
It's negative?No, it's positive.
What?It's not negative, it's positive.
Are you sure?Yeah, I lied before.
Now you know how you really feel about it.That's a risky little game.
Are you really gonna do this?
Yeah.
I'm gonna have a baby.
I'm the nice one!
I'm so glad.
Thank you for staying so calm during this.
It's made me stay calm.
I could've been worse.
I'll be right there.
If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler.
But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. And Mrs. Bing.
Please leave a message for... the Bings!
Hey, Maureen!
Hi!
This is my cousin, Maureen.
We're the Bings.
Hi!
You guys look so beautiful.
Mr. And Mrs. Bing!
Monica.
So you know, I had my "older brother" talk with Chandler.
What is that?
I told him that if he ever hurt you...
...I would hunt him down and kick his ass.
What is the matter with everybody?
I'm serious.
I would kick his ass!
Ross, please, my makeup!
Chandler.
Mom.
Thanks for wearing... something.
This is so exciting!
I thought we screwed you up too much for this.
Just think, soon there will be lots of little Bings.
I can't believe I'm going back to work to get spit on again.
You're lucky.
At least the people that spit on you are famous.
Who spits on you?
I don't want to talk about work.
Mrs. Bing?
These are my parents, Judy and Jack Geller.
It's lovely to meet you.
Are you his mother or father?
Jack!
What?
I've never seen one before.
Dad, there's Ross.
Go talk to him.
I wasn't even able to act like I'm okay with it.
Hello, all.
Hi... Dad.
Hi, Mr. Bing.
Nora.
Charles.
It's so great to see you both here.
Yes.
Although we may be seeing too much of some people.
Aren't you a little old to wear a dress like that?
Don't you have a little too much penis to wear a dress like that?
Oh, my God.
Of course you can kick his ass, son.
You could kick anyone's ass you want to.
Thanks, you guys.
Rach, Rach?
Yeah?
Talk to Chandler's dad and keep him away from Chandler's mom.
But I don't know what he looks like.
He's the man in the black dress.
Hi!
I'm Rachel, a friend of Monica and Chandler's.
I'm Amanda.
Oh, I get it.
"A man, duh!"
Could I have your attention?
I'm Ross Geller.
Dr. Ross Geller.
Dad, please.
As I was saying...
...I'm Dr. Ross Geller.
And I'm the best man.
This marriage is doubly special for me... ...because not only is the groom my best friend... ...but the bride is my little sister.
She's the greatest sister a guy could ask for.
Please join me in raising a glass... ...to the couple we're here to celebrate.
To the Bings.
To the Bings!
Found the vest.
What's that like?
Please don't be from a real dinosaur.
Please, please.
Please, please.
"Made in Mexico."
Yes!
Who would buy this?
Rach, it's me.
Pick up!
What's up?
Hello, Ross?
It's Emily here.
I know this is out of the blue, but I'm getting married tomorrow.
Well, maybe I am...
I keep thinking about you.
And I'm wondering if we made a mistake giving up so fast.
Are you thinking about me?
No, of course you're not.
But if you are, call me tonight.
Okay, bye.
What are you doing here?
Hey, you know what?
You are in our apartment all the time!
This is just a drop in the bucket, mister!
It doesn't matter.
The important thing is that you're here.
You're my friend and you're here.
Okay.
Why are you here?
I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing... ...but Emily called you today.
You talked to her?
She left a message.
But it kind of got erased.
I mean, there's something wrong with your machine.
What did she say?
Something about having second thoughts about the wedding... ...and did you guys make a mistake breaking up?
And she wants you to call her.
Wow.
That was a good thing that I told you, right?
Yeah.
Yes.
Of course.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
Because I'm gonna go tell Monica I was right.
Because she didn't want Not important.
Point is, I was right.
Your decision.
Okay?
I was right.
Your decision.
Right.
I guess I should call Emily.
No, that's not the right decision.
That's not right.
Ross, come on!
I mean... ...that woman made you miserable!
Do you really want to get back into that?
Okay, look.
Yesterday...
...I wouldn't have even considered calling her back.
But my exwife calls on the same day...
...I have a neardeath experience?
That's gotta mean something.
That was not a neardeath experience.
That was barely an experience.
You weren't there!
Maybe this is something that I'm supposed to seize, you know?
Okay.
You know what?
Maybe this is not about seizing stuff.
Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
Okay?
Look at today.
I mean, you escaped... ...death.
And maybe this is a chance for you to escape... ...getting back together with Emily.
That does make sense.
Because I do want to seize some opportunity... ...but I really don't want to see or talk to her.
Well, there you go!
Yeah, maybe today's just... ..."close call" day.
Hey, thanks, Rach.
Oh, honey.
No problem.
Wait, wait.
The message is blinking.
Maybe you didn't erase it.
Hey, Ross, it's you That's an old message.
Nobody needs to hear that.
Hey, was Monica here?
Yeah.
I want my money back.
You probably need that for stamps, right?
I'll order everyone the Moroccan chicken.Oh, I don't eat meat.
It's chicken!
I don't eat that either.I never understand you lesbians.
So, baby, tell me, what's new with you?Well, actually..
Your '74 Lafite, sir.
I ordered the '75.
That's amagnificent wine.
The '74 is sewage!
Why would you bring me sewage?
Is that a hard question?
Are you an idiot?Is that why you're a waiter?
This is why I told the managerI wouldn't wait on you.
Oh, come on.Don't be such a baby.
In case you didn't notice,that is a scary man.
He's right, though.The '74 is absolute piss.
This was such a huge mistake.I can't tell him, Phoebe.
I can't.
Rachel..
I'm gonna wait a couple of years,and then the baby will tell him.
Why?
So he can get mad at the baby?Hey, that is the baby's problem.
Everything okay with the waiter?I have no idea.
I went to the bathroom.
So, sweetie, you were startingto tell me what is new with you.
I got TiVo.
What's TiVo?It's slang for "pregnant."
Well, what were you thinkingasking me to come?
Are you really pregnant?
Well, yes and no.
Except, not no.
So to sum it up, yeah.
Who is the father?Oh, no.
Please don't tell me it's her.
No, it's Ross.
It's Ross.
You like Ross.
Daddy, I hope you're okaywith all of this.
Think about it.
This is a good thing.This is your first grandchild!
You're gonna be a poppy!
That's true.
I'm a poppy!
I'm gonna be a poppy!
So when is the wedding?The who?
The wedding.There's going to be a wedding.
Young lady, don't you sit there and tell memy first grandchild is gonna be a bastard!
Tell me there's gonna be a wedding!February 2nd!
I'm sorry I won't make it to yourimaginary wedding, but I'm busy that day.
I already have a unicorn baptismand a leprechaun bar mitzvah.
I know, I know.
I panicked.
I didn't want him to start yelling at melike I was some '74 Latour.
It's Lafite.
The '74 Latour is actuallydrinking quite nicely.
All right, here he comes.
I'm gonna tell him.I'm gonna be strong.
I just called a friend of mine.
I think I may be ableto book The Plaza on short notice.
Really?
The Plaza?
Oh, Daddy!
Right.
Daddy, I need to talk to you.What is it, sweetie?
There's not gonna be a wedding.Ross and I aren't getting married.
I'm sorry, Daddy.I don't believe this!
Daddy, stay calm, please.How do you expect me to stay calm?
This is unacceptable, Rachel.And I wanna know why!
Is it because that punkwon't marry you?
Is that it?Yes.
He says I'm damaged goods.
You nervous about getting married?
I just thought we should hang out.
I mean, you know, we've never really talked.
I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us.
I know.
I probably shouldn't even tell you this... ...but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
Really?
Me?
Oh, my God, are you kidding?
Ross is so crazy about you... ...and I really wanted you to like me, and I...
It's probably me just being totally paranoid... ...but I kind of got the feeling that maybe you don't.
Well, you're not totally paranoid.
When you and Ross first started going out... ...it was really hard for me... ...for many reasons of which I'm not gonna bore you with now.
I see how happy he is and how good you guys are together.
And Monica's always saying how nice you are... ...and God, I hate it when she's right!
Thanks.
Would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
Yeah, that'd be great.
I'd love it.
I'd love it too.
Shoot, I gotta go.
So I'll talk to you later.
All right, Julie.
What a manipulative bitch.
It's not bad
You know, there already is a Joseph Stalin?
You're kidding!
Apparently, he was a Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people!
You'd think you would have known that!
You'd think I would have.
Phoebe, what do you think a good stage name for me would be?
Flame Boy!
Where exactly is your zoo?
Well, it's technically not a zoo per se.
It's more of an interactive wildlife experience.
Let me ask you some questions about.
Is it Marcel?
Does he fight with other animals?
No, no.
He's very docile.
Even if he were cornered?
Well, I don't know.
Why?
How is he at handling small objects?
He can hold a banana, if that's what you mean.
What about a hammer or a small blade?
Why would he need a blade?
If he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns you've got to give the Little guy something.
Otherwise, it's just cruel!
He got into San Diego!
What?
We were coming back from our walk, and the phone was ringing.
He's in!
Did you hear that, Marcel?
It's San Diego!
San Diego!
You're making a mistake.
San Diego's well and good but if you give him to me, I'II start him against a blind rabbit and give you 20% of the gate.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 67 to San Diego boarding at gate 42A.
Okay, goodbye, Little monkey guy.
AII right, I wrote you this poem.
Okay, but don't eat it till you get on the plane.
Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
Okay, bye, champ.
There's gonna be a Lot of babes in San Diego but remember, there's also a Lot to learn.
I don't know what to say.
It's a monkey.
Just say what you feel.
Marcel, I'm hungry.
That was good.
Marcel, this is for you.
It's just, you know, something to do on the plane.
If you don't mind, I'd Like a moment, just me and him.
Oh, sure.
Absolutely.
Go ahead.
Marcel, come here.
Come here.
Come here.
Well, buddy this is it.
There's just a couple of things I wanted to say.
I'm really gonna miss you.
You know, I'm never gonna forget about you.
You've been more than just a pet to me.
You've been more Like a.
Would you leave my Leg alone?
Would you just stop humping me for two seconds?
Okay, would you just take him away?
Just take him.
O, that I were a glove upon that hand that I might touch thy cheek!
That's fine.
Thank you.
Next.
I'II be reading for the role of Mercutio.
Name?
Holden McGroin
Is someone in there?
I'm playing a daredevil game... ...called "Wait Until the Last Moment Before I Burst and Die."
Jeez, man!
Did you fall...?
Hi!
So did you?
Did you fall high?
Someone was in the ladies' room.
I couldn't wait.
I left the lid up for you, though.
You know what, Gunther?
Go ahead.
I'm talking to...
This is where you say your name.
Ginger.
Ginger.
I'm talking to Ginger, so... Don't you have to use the bathroom?
No, I just...
I'd rather talk to you.
Yes, I do.
Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.
There's someone in here.
He said he had to go back to his job and... Joey?
Joey Tribbiani?
I can see you, okay?
You're hiding behind the coats.
Close one.
Hi.
Hi, sweetie.
My milk's gone bad.
I hate that.
I once had a thing of halfandhalf.
Stole my car.
So how was your date with Ginger?
Great.
It was great.
She's... She's great.
Great looks and personality.
Greatness.
Sounds like she's got the... ...whole package.
So she's got it all, huh?
Joey told you about the leg, huh?
Oh, God!
It freaked me out.
It shouldn't, but it did.
I wanna keep seeing her, but it's like: "Hey, you know what?
Where's your leg?"
I'm the smallest person in the world, aren't I?
Morning.
Actually, he's the smallest person in the world.
Heard about the legburning, huh?
It came up.
Listen, I know it's a long shot, but... ...by any chance, did she find that funny?
You're thinking about my leg.
Actually, I forgot.
What's the deal with that again?
Look, it's okay if it bothers you.
I only need to know how much it bothers you... ...because I don't like wasting my time.
Am I wasting my time?
No, I don't think so.
It's like anything else.
You just have to get used to it.
What's that?
That's my "nubbin."
What's a nubbin?
It's kind of a thirdnipple kind of thing.
You have three nipples?
Well, you know, two regulars... ...and one that barely qualifies as a... What?
Nothing.
You know, I...
I just remembered.
I have to leave.
You have to leave?
Now?
How come?
Well, it's nubbin.
The doctor.
Is everything okay?
Just had me a little nubbinectomy.
Two nipples, no waiting.
Well!
Just like Rachel in high school.
What?
Come on, I was kidding!
It was such an obvious joke.
That was an obvious joke.
And I didn't think of it.
Why?
The source of all my powers.
Oh, dear God, what have I done
Geez, Ross, you could have showered./It's the dog.
Groomsmen, why are you just standing there?
Where is your bridesmaid?
We've got a broken arrow.
Bridesmaid down.
Oh, it's me.
Ready?/Okay./Okay.
Wait.
Oh, no.
Wait.
Wow.
But aren't you going to be cold?/I don't care.
I'llI'llI'll be my "something blue."
You look beautiful./Thank you.
Oh, my god.
Aren't you freezing?/Nahah.
Friends, family, dog,  thank you all for you being here to witness this blessed event.
The cold has now spread to my special place.
So I'm gonna do the short version of this.
Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other.
And I know I speak for everyone here   when I wish in my lifetime of happiness.
Who has the rings?
Okay.
When I was growing up, I didn't have normal mom and dad,  or regular family like everybody else.
and I always knew that someing was missing  Now I'm standing here today   knowing that I have everything I'm ever going to need.
You are my family.
Phoebe you are so beautiful.
You are so kind, you are so generous.
You are so wonderfuly weird.
Everyday with you is an adventure.
I can't believe how lucky I am.
I can't wait to share my life with you forever.
Oh, wait I forgot.
"and I love you" "and you have nice eyes".
I love you, too.
Uh, Joey, Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
Okay, Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?/I do.
Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?/I do.
I now pronounce you "husband and wife".
I got married.
Could someone get me a coat?
I'm freaking freezing.
Maybe he hooked up with the hot girl he was talking to.
Come on, Chappy.
"If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off. "
You gonna crash on the couch?
No, I gotta go home sometime.
Are you gonna be okay?
Look what I just found on the floor.
What?
That's Paul's watch.
You can just put it back where you found it.
Oh, boy!
All right.
Good night, everybody.
Good night.
I'm sorry.
No!
No, have it, really.
Split it?
You probably didn't know this, but back in high school I had a major crush on you.
I knew.
You did?
I figured you thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
I did.
Listen, do you think.
And try not to let my vulnerability become any kind of a factor here.
Do you think it would be okay if I asked you out sometime, maybe?
Maybe.
Okay, maybe I will.
Good night.
Good night.
See you.
Wait, wait.
What's with you?
I just grabbed a spoon.
IKEA, this is comfortable.
This place is amazing.
Oh, God!
That's the nicest kitchen.
I know.
It's the nicest kitchen.
The refrigerator told me to have a great day.
Look, a millionaire's checkbook.
Joey, put that down.
Oh, my God, that's Pete.
Get out!
How the hell do you answer a videophone?
Monica?
I guess that's how.
Monica, how's it going?
Oh, it's good.
It's good.
Just here, watering the plants.
Don't forget that ficus there by Rachel.
Chandler's on the couch!
I see him.
You guys are the worst hiders, ever.
Hi.
How you doing?
Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk... ...just so I know, is it good news or bad news?
It's good news.
It's definitely good news.
Hold on a second, I have another call.
How's it going?
It's still me.
No.
I've got pictureinpicture here.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm gonna have to call you back later.
Monica?
You.
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Okay.
So I'll see you soon.
Okay.
I love you.
I love you.
We love you too!
Well, it's good news.
It's good news.
What do you think the good news is?
Look at this!
He wrote a check for $50,000 to "Hugo Lindgren's Ring Design."
Sorry.
What do you think the good news is?
Oh, my!
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!
You gotta get Mom on the phone!
Call Mom!
Call Mom!
And that's Pete's mom.
You have to make it a theme wedding.
And the theme could be: "Look how much money we've got!"
I mean, you could put money in the invitations.
You could have, like, little money place settings.
And you could start with a money salad.
I mean, it'll be dry, but people will like it.
Would you stop?
We've only gone out a couple of weeks.
We don't know if he'll propose.
But this is Pete.
He's not like other people.
On your first date, you went to Rome.
For most guys, that's like a third or fourth date kind of thing.
Well, if that's what it is, then it's crazy.
Monica's right.
We're talking about marriage here.
She can't just rush into this.
What do you know?
You married a lesbian!
I was imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet.
Excuse me.
So there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
Oh, right.
I completely forgot about that.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
And I look at my life...  Yeah.
...and I feel like I've conquered the business world.
And I feel like I've conquered the intellectual world.
And now I have the most beautiful woman in the world.
Wow.
But there's one thing missing.
What's that?
It's time for me to conquer the physical world.
Okay.
Monica, I wanna become... ...the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
You wanna what?
I wanna become the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
It's the most intense physical competition in the world.
It's banned in 49 states.
What are you talking about?
My trainer, Hoshi, is teaching me... ...a combination of Jeet Kune Do and Brazilian streetfighting.
I even had my own octagon training ring designed.
And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
Yeah.
Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win.
I want you close enough to smell the blood.
What do you think?
My parents will be so happy.
I am Guru Saj.
This is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies.
Can I speak to your supply manager, please?
Earl.
Thanks.
Hi, Earl.
This is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies.
I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.
I don't need any toner.
I hear what you're saying, but at our prices, everyone needs toner.
Not me.
May I ask why?
You want to know why?
I surely do.
Okay.
I don't need any toner... ...because I'm gonna kill myself.
Is that because you're out of toner?
Okay, so no toner today.
Thanks anyway.
Byebye.
Wait, wait!
I can't let you hang up.
Just please talk to me.
Well...
I only had one thing to do today.
I guess I could push it back.
Yeah.
Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
I've been working for 10 years now at this... ...meaningless, deadend job... ...and nobody here even knows that I exist.
Chandler?
I'm sorry?
Look...
...I'm sure that people know you exist.
Oh, yeah?
I work in a cubicle... ...surrounded by people.
I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself... ...and no one's even looked up from their desk.
Hang on.
Hey, everybody...
...I'm gonna kill myself.
Let's just forget about the people at the office, okay?
There's gotta be someone worth sticking around for.
What about family or friends?
Maybe a girlfriend?
Yeah, right.
Oh, sorry.
Boyfriend?
Oh, God.
Okay, I should... ...be getting back to my thing now.
See you.
I'm not finished!
Don't you dare hang up on me!
The new girl's good.
Hey, guys.
I just whipped us up some EasyBake treats.
These are yours right here.
Okay.
A coloring book.
You loved that thing.
You never went anywhere without... ...without that coloring book.
Really?
Looks like I had trouble staying in the lines.
Nuhuh!
Wow, look at this.
I can't believe I even fit into this shirt.
Oh, this is yours.
I don't know how that got in there.
This isn't mine.
Hey, this isn't my stuff.
Ross, these are your boxes.
Where are my boxes?
Your boxes are... What?
Dad?
The garage flooded, sweetie, and ruined your boxes.
I'm sorry.
Just mine?
I'm afraid so.
Why wasn't Ross' stuff ruined?
And if you say the words "medical marvel," I'm going to EasyBake your head.
I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
Ross' stuff is fine, but I have no memories... ...so you could keep the bottom of your car from water?
There was also leaves and gook and stuff.
I can't believe this!
Screw it.
I'm having one.
So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
I'd love to ask you in, but my sister's visiting.
I think she's asleep on the couch.
Your sister?
Your sister's asleep on the couch?
I saw you with her on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
I thought I heard you.
Hey, great, you're up.
Rachel, my sister Krista.
Nice to meet you.
I wish you'd warned me.
I'd have fixed myself up.
Like it would help.
You are so bad.
You are.
You are.
You are.
You are!
You are so dead.
I'm gonna get you.
Come here!
It's very nice to meet you.
Can I ask you guys something?
I don't have brothers, so I don't know, but did you guys wrestle?
Oh, yeah.
All the time.
In fact, I was undefeated.
Well, you weighed 200 pounds.
Still, I was quick as a cat.
I met Danny's sister yesterday.
That was the girl on the subway.
You're kidding.
They were very, you know... ...wrestley.
But I guess that's normal?
We don't wrestle now.
Not since I got too strong for you.
Too strong for me?
You wanna go right now?
I'll take you right now, buddy!
You wanna go?
Oh, fine.
Ready?
Wrestle!
Okay, you know what?
Actually, that helps a lot.
Thanks.
Let's go!
The puck drops in 20 minutes!
Now no one's going to the game.
I paid for those!
You said you would, but you didn't.
Oh, yeah.
We finally get to the top of the mountain... ...and airhead here forgets the camera.
The same thing happened to me one time.
When did that happen to you?
Remember?
We were jogging and saw that bird.
I wanted to take a picture, but I didn't have my camera.
Chasing the churro guy is not jogging.
Oh, this is so good.
You have got to try it.
Damn.
I got it on my pants.
Here, I'll get it.
We better take them off or the stain will set.
I want to wear them tonight.
Oh, great.
Okay, bye.
Oh, my God!
That was unbelievable.
See?
I told you.
Yeah.
Sorry.
I don't believe they're brother and sister.
They're brother and sister?!
I guess you'll have to cancel your date.
I thought we said 7.
You know what?
Let's skip it.
What?
Why?
You and your sister seem to have a very special bond Oh, great.
That "special bond" again.
Why do women have a problem with my being close to my sister?
I don't know, but Do you have brothers?
No, I have two sisters.
But one has a very masculine energy.
Are you close?
No.
They're not very nice people.
I like you.
I think this could go somewhere.
So I'm close to my family.
Don't let it stand in our way.
Well, I don't know...
When you put it that way Danny?
Hurry up.
The bath's getting cold.
I'll see you later.
It just seems so futile.
You know?
All these women, and nothing!
I feel like Superman without my powers, you know?
I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
Well, now you understand how I feel every single day.
The world is my lesbian wedding.
Butterscotch?
No one?
All right, you'll be sorry later.
Thank you.
Anytime.
Ross.
Nothing makes God happier... ...than when two people, any two people, come together in love.
Friends, family, we're gathered here today... ...to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.
Oh, my God!
Now I've seen everything!
She's gone!
She's gone.
Go ahead, get married.
Go, go!
Strangers in the night Exchanging glances Wondering in the night Would you look at them?
Yeah.
Can't help but.
How's that pigintheblanket working out for you?
I wrapped those bad boys.
I miss Rose.
Oh, yeah?
I know it's kind of weird, but she was a big part of my life...
I don't know, I feel alone.
You know, I couldn't help overhearing what you just said.
I think it's time you forget about Rose, move on with your life.
How about we get you a drink?
Okay.
So nice!
I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?
Hey, Mom, having fun?
Am I!
I just danced with a wonderfully large woman.
And three other girls made eyes at me over at the buffet.
I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue... ...but it's nice to know I have options.
There's more alcohol, right?
How you doing?
You did a good thing today.
You wanna dance?
No, that's fine.
Come on.
I'll let you lead.
Look, penis, schmenis!
Okay?
We're all people.
And this is Funny Clown.
It's only for after his naps, not before, or he won't sleep.
We've been through this before.
We have a good time.
We laugh, we play.
It's like we're father and son.
Honey, relax.
Ross is great with him.
Don't look so surprised.
I'm a lovely person.
This is so cute!
I got that for him!
"My Mommies Love Me."
That's clever.
Oh, hi, Jul... Hi, Jew!
Thanks, Aunt Pheebs.
Did you microwave that?
You can't do that to breast milk.
I think I know how to heat breast milk.
What did you just do?
I licked my arm, what?
It's breast milk!
So?
Phoebe, that is juice squeezed from a person.
What is the big deal?
What did you just do?
Can people stop drinking the breast milk?
You won't even taste it?
Not even if you just pretend it's milk?
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
I tasted Ben's milk and Ross freaked out.
I did not freak out.
Why'd you freak out?
Because it's breast milk.
It's gross!
My breast milk is gross?
This should be fun.
There's nothing wrong with it.
I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
Of course, the packaging does appeal to grownups and kids.
Don't be silly.
I've tried it.
It's no big deal.
Just taste it.
That would be no.
Come on.
Try it.
It's natural.
It doesn't taste bad.
Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet.
Sort of like... Like what?
Cantaloupe juice.
Exactly.
You've tasted it.
Oh, you've tasted it.
You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.
Give me the bottle.
Get me the towel.
Show him that you're the baddest Hombre west of the lingerie!
I'm gonna do it!
All right!
Okay, Daddy.
We'll see you tomorrow night.
Okay, bye.
"We"?
Are having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night.
I hope that's okay.
Oh, shoot!
Tomorrow's not good.
I'm supposed to fall off the Empire State Building... ...and land on a bicycle with no seat, so... Ross, my father doesn't hate you.
Please.
He refers to me as "WetHead."
Honey, he calls everybody by a nickname.
I know.
Just one dinner.
One night.
For me.
Please?
I just want him to love you like I do.
All right.
Well, not exactly like I do.
But if you do come to dinner...
...I'll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.
I'll go.
Fine.
Hi, Daddy!
This is where they put us?
What, there was no table available in the kitchen?
Hello, baby.
You remember Ross.
Nice to see you again, Dr. Greene.
So... How's the library?
Museum.
What happened to the library?
There never was a library.
I mean, there are libraries.
It's just... ...that I've never worked at one.
You know what's really good here?
The lobster.
What do you say?
Shall I order three?
Lf you're really hungry.
It was a joke.
I made a joke.
Actually, Daddy, Ross is allergic to lobster.
What kind of person's allergic to lobster?
I guess the kind of person that works in a library.
It's not...
I know.
It's a museum!
You're the only who can make a joke?
At least mine was funny.
Waiter.
We will have two lobsters and a menu.
So, Dr. Greene, how's the old boat?
They found rust.
Do you know what rust does to a boat?
Gives it a nice antiquey look?
Rust is boat cancer, Ross.
Wow, I'm sorry.
When I was a kid, I lost a bike to that.
Excuse me for a moment, will you?
I wanna say good night to the Levines before we go.
Honey, stop.
It's not that bad.
Your dad must have added wrong.
He only tipped like 4%.
Yeah.
That's Daddy.
"That's Daddy"?
Doesn't it bother you?
You're a waitress.
Yes, it bothers me.
If he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers.
So?
So, Ross...
...I've bugged him about this a million times.
He won't change.
Do you really serve people sneezers?
Well, I don't.
All right, kids.
Ready?
Thanks again, Dr. Greene.
Wait, I think I forgot my receipt.
You don't need that.
Why not?
The carbon.
It's messy.
I mean, gets on your fingers and causes... ...night blindness.
What is this?
Who put a 20 down here?
Huh?
Oh, yeah, that would be me.
I have a problem.
I tip way too much.
Way too much.
It's a sickness, really.
Yeah, it is.
We have to do something about that.
Excuse me.
You think I'm cheap?
He didn't mean anything by that.
He really didn't.
Nothing I do means anything.
Really.
This is nice.
I pay $200 for dinner.
You put down $20 and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot.
You really want to be Mr. Big Shot?
Here.
I'll tell you what: You pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot.
All right?
Well, "Mr. Big Shot" is better than "WetHead."
This is not the bed I ordered.
I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sundried tomato business.
Years ago, if somebody'd said, "Here's a tomato that looks like a prune" I'd have said, "Get out of my office! "
Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
I'm not freaking out!
I'm just saying if someone had come to me with the idea.
I'm talking about the whole baby thing.
Did you ever get this sort of panicky, "Oh, my God, I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
Your mother did the work.
I was busy with the business.
I wasn't around that much.
Is that what this is about?
No, no.
I was just wondering.
There's time to make up for that.
We can do stuff together.
You always wanted to go to coIonial Williamsburg.
How about we do that?
Thanks, Dad, really.
You know, I just, I just.
I just needed to know when did you start to feel like a father?
Well, I guess it must have been the day after you were born.
We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep and they brought you in and gave you to me.
You were this ugly little red thing!
And all of a sudden, you grabbed my finger with your whole fist and you squeezed it so tight.
And that's when I knew.
So you don't want to go to Williamsburg?
We can go to Williamsburg.
Eat your fish.
Rachel, the cute doctors are here!
Okay, worst case scenario: Say you never feel like a father.
Say your son never feels connected to you as one.
Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
Do you have a point?
You know, you'd think I would.
What's up with the simian?
It's just a fur ball.
Whose turn is it?
Yours.
I got 43 points for "kidney. "
No, you got zero points for "idney. "
I had a "K. " Where's my "K"?
You've got to help me!
My monkey swallowed a "K" !
Get that animal out of here!
The animal hospital is across town.
He's choking!
What is it?
Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
Excuse me.
This hospital is for people!
He is people!
He has a name, okay?
He watches Jeopardy!
He touches himself when nobody's watching.
Please have a heart.
I'll take a look at him.
Thank you.
Michael!
Rachel.
What?
Monica.
Urs!
He looks so tiny.
We just got the message.
Is he okay?
The doctor got the "K" out.
He also found an "M" and an "O. "
We think he was trying to spell out "monkey. "
The doctor says he'll be fine.
He's just sleeping now.
So you feel like a dad yet?
No.
Why?
Come on, you came through.
You did what you had to do.
That's very "dad. "
He's waking up.
Hey, fella.
How you doing
Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?
You pierced her ears?
How could you do this without telling me?
Well, if I had told you,  then it wouldn't have been a surprise.
Now would it?
I think she looks cute  but I am wrong  Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Here comes Ross.
He is going to flip out  Why?
Did something happen to his falafel cart?
Hi Guys / Hey Ross  Ross / Hi Emma  Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low?
She can barely see  I don't really want her to see  Why, why not?
Because there are so many terrible sights in this world  Like war  or that that thing in Joey's refrigerator.
Remember?
It was in a milk carton but it, it looked like meat.
Come here, come here.
HA!
There she is.
Hi   What?
Nothing  Hi   What?
Please tell me those are clipons.
Oh, they're real  Did she do this to her?
I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her  I know.
I know and you were right, Ross.
Okay?
You are so irresponsible.
I am never letting you babysit ever again  Hey, you know what?
This kid needs me, okay?
She needs to have a cool fun aunt.
I'm a cool fun aunt / Okay  Hey, Monica can be cool and fun  and organize indoor projects.
I can't believe this.
All I wanted to do is help you  try to figure out what to do with your life  And this is how you repay me?
Well, I don't need you to help me  because I already know what I'm going to do with my life  Oh, yeah?
Since when?
Since today  I am going to be...  a babystylist  What?
That's not a thing!
Well, it should be.
I'm going to help babies learn how to accesorize,  what colors to wear,  what clothes are slimmin'  Babies don't care if they're slim!
Enter Amy  Amy, I just, I just, I just want to....  What?
What are you going to do?
No more falafel for you!
She was nice  Joey, get Amy's bags.
She is moving out!
Oohoo!
You're kicking me out?!
You put holes in my baby's ears.
Yeah, well, at least now people will know she's a girl!
I can't believe I have even tried to help you!
You are so beyond help  You know what?
Ever since I've got here, you have been nothing but negative  Excuse me?
You didn't want me to marry  the old guy with the great apartment  Then I tried to help your daughter deemphasize her flaws  And suddenly I'm the bad guy?
You know what?
When I moved in here, I thought this is going to be so great.
Just us sisters back together again like when we were kids  except without that stupid Jill.
Oh, who has gotten fat by the way?
Seriously?
/ Umhmm  Mom says she gained like 15 pounds  Hips or thighs?
Ass and face / Oh!
Oh my God!
I thought she was on Atkins  She was.
Carbs found her   See?
This is what I wanted.
Two sisters talking about real stuff   Oh, I can't give you that  You can / Yeah  I just, I keep trying to make you a better person  but you're, you're already  a pretty perfect version of what you are  Thank you  I've got to admit Emma does look cute  Did you just say Emma?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Ella.
That woman at the game didn't know  what she was talking about  Mike, obviously you have balls  Please let's just forget the whole thing.
Yes   I love you  I love you more  Not possible   She's going to be Mrs. Noballs   So how's the baby styling business going?
Not that great.
It's...  it's almost as if people don't want to hear  that their babies are ugly  That's shocking  Oh, it's Ross  Hey, Ross  Hello, Ross  He's rud
So we're off.
Have fun!
I can't believe you won't be there.
I know.
Come.
Why don't you come?
To London.
Please?
It would mean so much to me.
I gotta work.
I'm sorry.
Why can't you take a couple of days off?
Because I can't.
I told you.
This is my wedding.
Now we are late.
Let's go, let's go!
Fine, you'll watch it on video when we get back.
Here you go, Phoebe!
What are you in the market for?
Scarves, souvenir postcards...
Check this out!
That's the stuff!
What do you think?
I won't need that "I'm with stupid" Tshirt anymore.
Well, I like it.
Here you go.
You're not really buying that.
Haven't you embarrassed me enough?
Oh, I embarrass you?
How can I answer when I'm pretending I don't know you?
He's just jealous.
All Londoners wear them.
Really?
Then how come no one here anywhere is wearing one?
They're all tourists.
If you insist on wearing that in public... ...you're gonna spend the afternoon all by yourself.
If you make me choose between you and the hat, I choose the hat.
Good choice.
Thanks.
That's it!
I'm out of here.
I won't be embarrassed any more.
How are you doing?
Joey Tribbiani, America.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said you were embarrassing me.
That wasn't cool.
If it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.
Me too.
Yeah?
No!
I had the best day ever!
Dude, check this out!
Tell my friend you like my hat.
What's your friend's name?
Chandler.
Hi, Chandler.
That's That's Fergie, baby!
Joey says you don't like his hat, but I think it's kind of dashing.
So I hear you're single now.
When did you?
How?
I was trying to get to Buckingham Palace.
So I'm in my map and I understand you had a talk with Emily.
Yes, I did.
And you are welcome.
Am I?
But imagine a lot more lights... ...and fewer bricks... ...and flowers and candles.
And the musicians can go over here.
The chairs can face this way and You go.
But if you don't love this, we'll do it any other place or time.
Really, it's fine.
Whatever you want.
It's perfect.
And, I don't know, if it rains Then we'll get wet.
Oh, the band's ready?
We gotta do what the band says, right?
I don't care about the stupid band!
Oh, hi, how are you?
Good.
Looks like we're the first ones here.
Looks that way.
First ones here!
Oh, Tommy, this is Ross.
Ross, Tommy.
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is Cailin.
Cailin...
Sorry.
And break!
I think I'm gonna run to the ladies' room.
I'll join you.
I'll get our seats.
Well, this is... ...awkward.
Well, because Rachel and I used to go out.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Well, then this is awkward.
So, what do you...?
I think we're here.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
I think you may be in our seats.
No, I don't think so.
Could we take a look at your ticket?
Sure.
Yeah.
Yeah, see, this says, "D13"... Oh, well, I thought that... You thought?
Well, that didn't really work out for you.
Idiot!
What are you, a moron?
It says, "D13"!
Okay?
You're surrounded by even numbers!
Does that give you a clue?
The usher told me...
The usher must be right!
With all his training!
Get out!
Here!
Hey, man, you want the aisle?
No, I'm good.
There he is!
There's our star!
You were great!
So?
What'd you think?
Almost as good as the play with the two naked girls on the seesaw.
I wasn't in that.
I know.
I want you to meet everybody.
Everybody, this is Kate.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Sweetheart!
Come!
So that's the girl you like.
I tell you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy.
He viciously screamed at total strangers.
I think he's bad news.
Wait a minute.
You don't like the guy Rachel's dating?
Well, that's odd.
Oh, hey, Lauren.
You guys, this is Kate's understudy, Lauren.
Hey, gosh, you look so familiar.
I ran into you in the hallway in your building.
It was right after I slept with Joey.
He dumped me the next day.
So how'd you guys meet?
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!
You guys, this is my agent, Estelle.
How do you do?
Oh, you two girls were outstanding!
Do they have representation?
They weren't in the play.
We're not actors.
What a shame!
With her face and her chest, I could really put something together.
Could I borrow it?
Hi.
Remember me?
Hi.
Yeah.
Tommy's in line for the bathroom... ...and someone just cut.
I think he's gonna snap.
I'm gonna go.
Go?
Why?
I don't know.
Could be because I don't feel like... ...waiting all night for a guy who may or may not scream.
He definitely will scream.
Goodbye.
Here we go, people!
"Boxing Day.
The Lucille Lortel Theatre... Joey Tribbiani gives an uneven performance.
But Mr. Tribbiani is not the worst thing in this production."
Yes!
"Kate Miller's awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable."
Here it is!
"The direction... ...by Marshall Townend is..." Thank you, boys and girls.
You've ruined my life.
Please stuff your talentless faces... ...with my mother's crab cakes!
Excuse me!
Does anyone mind if I save this?
So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up.
So Ross selflessly offered to take me.
What a nice story.
So Ross was in college... and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her prom.
I definitely did not see that one backfiring.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Take your time.
I was a freshman and she was a senior.
So it wasn't as bad as.. Look.
I know I've been giving you a lot of jabs.
It's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie... and partly because they just keep coming to me.
I admit after all the wonderful things Lizzie told me... and the many, many, many stories that Rachel has told me... well... you're not... all bad.
"Not all bad."
I'm sorry I was so harsh.
But you have to understand.
I still look at Lizzie like she's a 12yearold girl.
I know what you mean.
I do that too.
I beg your pardon?
I don't see her as a 12yearold.
I mean, I have a son who is 6 and I still think of him as a baby.
A son?
My exwife and I share custody of Ben.
Incidentally, Carol and I are on excellent terms... as I'm sure you are with your wife.
I'm sorry.
It's unbelievable!
Don't worry.
I didn't realize you were married.
We were.
But that was just a... That was just a big drunken mistake.
You're back.
You two were married?
I'm sorry.
You were talking about Emily.
Well, if you think about it... Ross did learn something from each marriage.
How to make the next one even shorter?
Wait a minute.
That's not fair.
He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was to Emily.
He just didn't tell me.
Maybe I have to pee again.
Well, this is fun.
So, Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
I have had enough of this!
I care a great deal about your daughter.
And I have treated her with respect!
So if you've got a problem with me.. Are you yelling at me?
God, no.
You know what?
If you don't like Ross, that's fine.
It doesn't matter.
I'm going out with him anyway.
Really?
Well, if it doesn't matter to her... it doesn't matter to me.
Still not yelling.
What can I say?
I still don't like you.
I'm not so crazy about myself right now either.
Then we agree?
I guess so.
Neither of us like Ross.
I like Ross.
Kids!
I just thought of a story about how nice Ross is.
That's okay.
We're not liking Ross right now.
Well, I got a lot of those too.
Just call me angel Of the morning, angel Just touch my cheek Before you leave me, baby Just call me angel Of the morning, angel Then slowly turn away I won't beg you to stay With me Here.
I thought you might be cold.
Thank you.
Look at you!
You did pretty well.
$8.
27.
But not really, because I put in the first two.
Just to get the ball rolling and to make myself feel better.
Do you?
You know, this whole playing for money thing is so not good for me.
I don't know, when I sang "Sususuicide"...
...I got, like, $1.75.
But then "Smelly Cat"?
I got 25 cents and a condom.
So, you know, now I just feel really bad for "Smelly Cat."
Honey, I don't think everybody gets "Smelly Cat."
I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then whoosh!
But it's not even that, you know?
I used to do my songs because it made me happy.
Now it's just all about the money, you know?
Well, people missed you in there.
In fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat."
Really?
From who?
Well, me.
And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
Did I accidentally drop a condom in your case?
It's kind of an emergency.
Here you go.
Thanks a lot.
Hey, Christine!
I got it!
I'll get everybody.
Finally we can start celebrating my...
I'm sorry, apparently I opened the door to the past.
Okay, Monica, Mon.
Okay, what you just saw... Can I ask you just a little question?
Why tonight?
I waited my whole life to be engaged... ...and unlike some, I only plan on doing this once.
Maybe it's selfish, I'm sorry, but I hoped tonight could just be about that.
But it is just about that.
Now it's about you getting back together.
See, you kind of stole my thunder.
We did not steal your thunder.
We are not getting back together.
Yeah, no, and you know what?
Nobody even saw.
That's true.
We just kissed.
It was just a kiss.
You guys kissed?!
What does this mean?!
Are you back together?
Can I sing at your wedding?
Thunder being stolen.
Phoebe, it's nothing.
Let's not make a big deal of this.
It was a onetime thing.
It doesn't even matter.
Oh, my God.
I cannot believe you guys are talking about this.
Problems in the bedroom are between a man and a woman.
All right?
Now, Chandler is doing the best he can.
I don't think that's what they were talking about.
No, but let's talk about it.
What a great night.
Chandler can't do it, they kissed.
What?
You guys kissed?
This is huge.
No, it's not huge.
People thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe... ...we're stealing her thunder, which we aren't.
We're still talking about it.
Would you feel better if we stopped talking about Ross and Rachel?
That would be lovely.
You got it.
Now, I can pass for 19, right?
Yes, you can pass for 19.
Really?
Yes.
Seriously?
Seriously?
Seriously, no.
Okay?
You can play your own age, which is 31.
I'm 30!
Joey, you are not.
You're 31.
Oh, crap!
So the Plaza.
We'll get some mai tais?
Maybe no more for you though.
You know, I think I don't feel like going to the Plaza.
Monica, this is ridiculous.
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't.
Especially with you.
That is whack.
I'll play it at the wedding.
We'll see if they actually let you play.
They tell you anything you want to hear... ...like, "You look 19."
Then they just take it away, like, "No, you don't."
Monica won't take this away.
Wouldn't she?
Would she?
Would she?
It's starting to sound like "wood cheese."
Guess who.
Hey, I just realized we kind of left some stuff up in the air.
What did Monica mean: "I don't want to talk," especially with me?
Why not especially you and me?
We were both kissing.
Still thinking about it?
I'm serious.
What did she mean by that?
"Especially you."
Who cares?
I care.
And so do I. I have to talk to her.
Will you let me get changed?
Am I going to let you watch me?
You know, I don't really need their permission.
What'd he say that was so funny?
I have absolutely no idea.
That's classic.
My God, you guys!
What am I doing?
This is so unme!
If you want, I'll do it.
I just wanna bite his bottom lip.
But I won't.
The first time he smiled at me those seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
Did you rent mopeds?
Because I've heard.
Oh, it's not about that right now.
I know it's totally superficial, and we have nothing in common and we don't even speak the same language but God!
Listen.
Listen, something you should know.
Rachel and I are.
We're kind of a thing.
Thing?
Thing.
Yes, thing.
You have the sex?
Technically, the sex is not being had.
But that's.
That's not the point.
The point is that Rachel and I should be.
Well, Rachel and I should be together.
And if you get in the.
In bed?
No, not where I was going.
If you get in the way of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
So do you?
You do know a little English?
Little.
Do you know the word crapweasel?
That's funny, you are a huge crapweasel.
You gotta whip it.
Look, look!
The last candle's about to burn out.
1 0, 9, 8, 7.
Minus 46, minus 47, minus 48.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Kind of spooky without any lights.
Okay, guys, I have the definitive one.
This isn't the best time to bring it up but you have to throw a party for Monica.
Your last night, and I lose the two most important things: The foosball table... and $500.
There are other ways to win back your money.
How about blackjack?
Not my game.
You know what?
We can play a new game.
It's fun!
What's it called?
Cups.
I don't know how.
I'll teach you.
It's easy and fun.
All right.
Here you go.
I have two queens.
What do you have?
A 2 and a 5.
You win!
Fifty dollars!
Really?
Let's play again.
What have you got?
4 and a 9.
You're kidding, right?
No.
No, Phoebe, I am mad!
Well, deep down!
I'm just mad.
Then keep running.
You win!
What did you have?
Nothing beats... a three and a six.
That, my friend, is "D Cup."
How much have you won so far?
700.
Not 700 exactly?
Double it.
In Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
I didn't make up the rules.
Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get one card.
That one card could be worth $100, which brings your total to $1500.
Don't get excited, that won't happen unless you get the.. No way!
Oh, my God!
How's the packing going?
Ben?
He's fine.
He's right.. Oh, my God!
Get your head out of your shirt there, son!
Yeah, it's a pumpkin.
I'll come pack.
What's wrong?
Ross and I were helping pack... took a little break.
I lost $1500 to him in Cups!
How did you lose at Cups?
The same way you lost!
I started out with the king and the queen.
Bam!
Ross gets a 2 and a 3.
Then I get a jack and a king.
Boom!
Ross gets a 4 and 5.
Even Ross was getting the Cup card, the D Cup... the sittingdown bonus.
I didn't even get half a cup!
Nothing!
Oh, man!
He never played before either.
I think beginner's luck is very important in Cups!
Let's play one more hand.
Call me when you get there, okay?
Okay.
I'm really gonna miss you.
I have your key.
Here you go.
Thanks.
God, this is silly.
I'll see you in a couple of hours.
Bye, house.
She really left.
I know.
Thank you.
No problem, roomie.
Can I ask you a question?
Sure.
What the hell is that dog doing here?
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
And now you want that money back?
Exactly.
What kind of idiot do you take me for?
It's not a real game.
I made it up.
I'm sorry you lost your money.
But I won it fair and square.
At a fake game!
If you wanna try to make some of it back...
I'd be glad to play you for it.
But I should warn you.
I am very good at Cups.
I assume the saucer card came up when you played last.
Let's see if it comes up this time
I have something to tell you.
And I want you to let me get through it... ...because... ...it's not gonna be easy.
Okay.
I think you should go back with Gary.
I don't want to be the guy that breaks up a family.
You know, when my parents split up, it was because of that guy.
Whenever I would see him, I would always think: "You're the reason.
You are why they're not together."
And I hated that guy.
And it didn't matter how nice he was or how happy he made my dad.
It's the right thing to do.
You're right.
Oh, God.
But before I can say goodbye... ...there's something I really need you to know.
The way I feel about you... ...it's like I finally understand... ...what Lionel Richie's been singing about.
You know?
I mean, what we have... ...it's like movie love.
You're my soul mate.
I can't believe we're not gonna spend the rest of our lives together.
Then don't leave me.
What?
Forget what I said.
I was babbling.
Pick me!
No, you were right!
I gotta give my marriage another chance.
No, you don't!
I say, you have to give your divorce another chance!
I'll settle for a little, tiny... A ventricle.
I'm sorry.
Don't go.
No, I gotta go.
No.
No!
No, no.
Honey.
Honey.
People are looking.
I don't care.
I don't care!
Yeah, okay.
I'm...
I'm leaving now.
You can't leave!
I have your shoe!
Goodbye, Chandler Bing.
Rachel has those in burgundy.
Remember, something this big and long will be very difficult to maneuver.
Okay, a little higher.
Careful of the angle.
Okay, okay.
We're approaching the window.
Thread the needle.
Thread the needle.
He's alive!
He's alive!
And yet we're still poking him.
Okay, retract the device!
Retract the device!
He does not look happy.
Now he's showing us his poking device.
Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy
Hey, Phoebe.
Fatty.
Why so fancy?
I got a job interview.
It's more money, and I'd be doingdata reconfiguration.
I think I know someone who does that.Me.
I do that.
So do I look okay?I'm nervous.
Oh, yeah.
You look great.
You know, just don'tget your hopes up.
Why not?Well, the interview.
Yeah?You know.
You don't make a very goodfirst impression.
What?Oh, you don't know.
Are you serious?When I first met you, you were like:   I was like:   What is it that I do?
It's just, like, you're trying too hard,making jokes..   You come off a little needy.
Did you like me when we first met?
Chandler, I'm not gonna lie to you.But I am gonna run away from you.
I can't even believe this.I really come off that badly?
It's okay.
You calm downafter a while..   and then people seehow wonderful you are.
Good.
Because I'm sure thisinterview will last weeks.
All right, don't freak out, okay?I will help you.
How long before you have to leave?An hour.
I can't help you.Phoebe..   We'll do our best.
I'm the interviewerand I'm meeting you for the first time.
Okay.Hi.
Come on in.
I'm Regina Phalanges.
Chandler Bing.Oh, Bing.
What an unusual name.You should meet my Uncle Bada.
I'll let myself out.
Hats off to who?The chef!
That's right!
You'll find that I don't micromanage.I don't shy away from delegating.
That's good to know.
But let's stopfocusing on what you don't do..   and focus on what you do do.
What I do do..   is create an atmosphere of supportfor the people working with me.
Nice sidestep on the "do do" thing.
Hardest thing I've ever done.Oh, you gotta go!
Don't worry.
You're ready.Really?
Absolutely!
Just fight all yournatural instincts, and you'll be great.
I was the point person on my company'stransition from the KL5 to GR6 systems.
You must have had your hands full.That I did.
That I did.
So let's talk a little bitabout your duties.
My duties?
All right.
You'll be heading a whole division,so you'll have a lot of duties.
I see.But there'll be 30 people under you..   so you can dumpa certain amount on them.
Good to know.We could go into detail..   No, don't, I beg of you.
All right.
We'll have a definiteanswer for you on Monday.
But I can say with someconfidence, you'll fit in well here.
Really?Absolutely.
You can relax.
You did great.Yeah, thanks.
I was really nervous.I'm told I come on too strongly.
And then it was really hardto sidestep that "duty" thing.
Duties?
Doodies?
Poo?
Poo?
Oh, my God.
This doesn't count.
Okay?The interview was over.
That was the real Chandler Bing.This is some crazy guy.
Call security!
There's a crazy guyout in the hall!
Poo?
Yeah, this was a stupid idea
You know what?
I cannot do this with my left hand.
Would you please help me with this too?
Okay, let's use this brush.
Okay.
This stuff?
Careful.
Okay.
Light.
Just sweep it across the lid.
Just sweep it.
Sorry!
That's just poking me in the eye.
I'm sorry.
Close.
Just sweep it.
I'm sweeping.
Sweep, sweep.
Okay, now make it even because we don't... What?
I don't want it to be too much.
I want it to be subtle.
You don't wear enough of this.
Since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?
Close your eye.
You're gonna like this better.
Close, close.
Blow it.
Sorry.
Because I think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
Sophisticated like a hooker?
Hey.
Hey.
There you go!
Good enough for your party?
Sure.
Sure.
I'll just sit next to the transsexual from purchasing.
Come on!
Okay, come on.
All right, I gotta go, so good luck at the party, okay?
Oh, wait.
Ross, could you just stay and help me get dressed?
Sure.
Okay.
Okay, great.
Okay, just turn around.
What?
I don't want you to see me naked.
Rachel, I've seen you naked a million times.
I ate hot fudge off you naked.
I sucked that minimarshmallow out of your bellybutton.
Yeah, but that was different.
We were going out then.
Now it's weird.
Rach, you know, I can see you naked anytime I want.
What?
All I have to do is close my eyes.
See?
I don't want you thinking of me like that anymore.
Sorry.
Nothing you can do about it.
It's one of my rights as the exboyfriend.
Stop it!
Cut it out!
Cut it out!
I'm sorry.
It will never happen...
Wait a minute!
Wait, wait.
Now there are 100 of you, and I'm the king!
Ross.
Would you grow up?
It's no big deal.
All right.
Fine.
See what you did?
I'm gonna be doing it by myself now.
Oh, my God.
All right, look, look.
Okay.
Rach!
Easy.
Easy.
You have to go to the hospital, okay?
Okay, I do.
I really do.
Okay?
I'm gonna get your coat, then I'll put you in a cab.
Wait!
You're not gonna come with me?
Of course I am.
I just have to make a call.
Okay  Okay.
Thank you.
What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
I just can't go to the hospital looking like this.
Now, when you come back, I hope you remember that that chick is not a toy!
What thing?
What is this thing?
I was kind of supposed to be on TV tonight for the Discovery Channel.
Oh, my God!
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?
Because I knew that if I told you, you'd make me go... ...and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight.
Come on.
I cannot believe you.
What?
That is the sweetest thing.
You should get some sleep.
So I'll...
Sorry I spoiled your evening.
No, that's... No, as long as you're okay.
So I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah.
See you.
What did you do?
He and I used to play together in grade school, but now... Peter!
Hey, Peter!
It's me!
Rhonda, from P.S.
129?
I shared my pudding with you, man!
I gave you my Snack Pack!
See?
He pretend he don't even hear me!
Everyone's pretending they don't hear you.
I don't know about your jackets and separate tables... ...but Ross is my friend.
And if I save him a seat, he will sit in it.
Here!
I saved you a seat!
I'm cool here.
I'll catch up with you later.
This is saved.
Gift shop.
I'm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
You do what you got to do.
The scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
Whatever.
It's like that everywhere.
Mon, back me up.
Where you work, the waiters eat with the waiters.
And the chefs eat with the other chefs?
I eat by myself in the alley, because everybody hates me.
Okay, Rach, when was the last time you had lunch with the shipping clerks?
Look, Ross.
It's no big deal.
You wear a white coat.
I wear a blue blazer.
If that means we can't be friends at work, so be it.
I understand, you know?
When I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you.
So it's, you know, it's cool.
I'll see you tomorrow.
When we're in the audience, he doesn't talk but he does wave.
There's a seat here.
Thank you, Dr. Phillips.
But I'm having my lunch... ...at this table.
Here in the middle.
I'm having my lunch... ...right here with my good friend, Joey.
If he'll sit with me.
I will sit with you, Dr. Geller.
You know... ...we work in a museum of natural history.
And yet, there is something... ...unnatural... ...about the way we eat lunch.
Now, I want you to know... ...it took a tour guide to show this scientist the error of his ways.
I look around, and you know what I see?
I see division.
Division between people in white coats and people in blue blazers.
I ask myself, "My God, why?"
Now, I say we shed these coats... ...that separate us.
And we get to know the people underneath.
I'm Ross!
I'm divorced and I have a kid!
I'm Joey!
I'm an actor!
I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
I'm Ted, and I just moved here, and New York really scares me.
There you go!
Hang in there, Teddy!
I'm Andrew.
And I didn't pay for this pear.
Okay.
Good for you.
I'm Rhonda!
And these aren't real!
Wow, Rhonda.
I'm Scott.
Yeah, okay, Scott!
I flip the light switch on and off 17 times when I leave a room... ...or my family will die.
My mom's gonna be here any minute.
I left my keys here somewhere.
Well, let's look for them.
Hey, look!
Are these them?
No.
All right.
Here they are.
Good.
Thanks for your help.
Wait!
Sorry!
Mr. Paul?
Just call me Paul.
Paul.
I just wanted you to know that... Ross really is a great guy.
Maybe you could date him.
It'd save me the trouble of killing him.
Are you okay?
You don't look old enough to have a 20yearold daughter.
Well, we were very young when we had her.
We?
It usually takes two people to... Oh, no!
Yes!
Of course.
I know that!
What I meant was are you still "we" or are you just you?
I'm just me.
My wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
So you raised her all on your own?
Yes, I did.
What are you writing there?
Hi, Ross.
I was just getting him to like you.
Joey!
Ross, Joey is not here.
I'll just wait for him in here!
Ross, it's okay.
You can come out.
Yeah.
It's okay.
It's me... Mr. Stevens.
I didn't... Oh, my gosh.
I didn't even see you.
You did.
You came in, got all awkward and ran to the bedroom.
You were shouting, "Joey!"
Bye, Rachel.
Bye.
I'll call you later.
See you.
Bye, Ross.
What?
What the..?
How did...?
What?
You know, he lost his keys.
So he was looking for them.
In your mouth?
No!
Downstairs.
And we got to talking... for two hours.
I liked him.
I invited him for coffee.
You were at the coffeehouse!
What's the big deal?
So I kissed the guy.
He is my girlfriend's father.
It's weird!
You dated my sister!
That was different!
What?
Why?
This is weird for me!
Ross, look.
This is good for you.
Let's face it.
So far the guy's not loving you.
But I can turn that around.
I've got the inside track.
We could all go out to dinner.
And I could talk you up.
Plus the guy is a very successful lawyer.
How is that important?
It's important!
That's so soft.
Pillowcases!
"Zelda looked at the chimney sweep.
Her father, the vicar..." Vicar?
"...wouldn't be home for hours.
Her loins were burning.
She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his..." This is a dirty book!
Hey, Joey.
What are you doing?
Sweeping.
Why?
Does it turn you on?
No.
What if I was sweeping a chimney?
Joey, did you eat my face cream?
Where are you going?
The vicar won't be home for hours.
Joey, where did you learn that word?
Where do you think... ...Zelda?
You found my book?!
Yeah, I did!
Joey, what are you doing going into my bedroom?
I'm sorry.
I went in there to take a nap.
I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!
Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
Hey, Rach.
Joey.
Hey, Rach, do you smell smoke?
I get it.
Smoke, chimney, chimney sweep.
Very funny.
Ha, ha.
No, no, I'm serious.
You don't smell it?
Something's on fire.
No, I don't smell anything.
Oh, you know what?
It's probably just your burning loins.
Hey, what are you guys talking about?
Nothing.
Damn, this coffee's cold.
Do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?
You know, I cannot believe you told him.
Joey...
So I guess you bought that book after we broke up.
Yeah, I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
Oh, yeah?
Well, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines.
What's up?
Ross, how could you do that to an old man?
Hello, Zelda.
Who are you supposed to be?
The vicar.
Do you even know what a vicar is?
Like a goalie, right?
Look, that's enough.
Joey, I'm serious, all right?
It's enough.
You make stupid jokes and sleazy innuendoes... ...and it's just not funny anymore.
I'm sorry.
Rach, I'm sorry.
Maybe I could make it up to you by taking you roughly in the barn.
All right, that's it.
You wanna do it?
Let's do it.
That's right.
I wanna do it with you.
Been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
I did?
Yeah.
Oh, I've been waiting so long to get on that body.
This body?
Yeah, that's right.
Come on, Joey, sex me up.
You're starting to sound like the butcher's wife in chapter seven.
Come on, now.
Don't keep me waiting.
Get those clothes off.
But I'd keep that helmet on, because you're in for a rough ride.
I don't want to.
I'm scared.
Love your new nose!
Dr. Wolfson's an artist.
He removed my mole cluster.
Want to see?
No!
Please, let me.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Your hair sure is different.
We were just talking about that.
We can't believe how stupid we used to look.
Where's Monica?
She's upstairs.
Come down, everyone's here!
Ross, Rachel... ...and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.
Oh, my God!
What's the matter?
Is there something on my dress?
You look so different.
Terrific.
That dress, that body... Dude!
Sorry.
Yes, she's thin.
It's wonderful.
But we really want to hear... ...about Ross' new girlfriend.
Her name is Carol.
She's really pretty and smart.
She's on the lacrosse team and the golf team.
Can you believe it?
She plays for both teams.
So I guess I'll see you at dinner.
Dude!
Sorry.
Oh, my God!
That was so awesome.
You got him back for calling you fat.
He was drooling all over you.
That must have felt so great.
It didn't.
Yeah, I mean, I look great.
I feel great, and my heart's not in trouble anymore.
I just don't feel like I got him back.
I just want to humiliate him.
I want him to be naked, and I want to point at him and laugh.
That, we may be able to do.
How?
Guys tend to get naked before they're going to have sex.
What?
I didn't work this hard and lose weight... ...just so I could give my flower to someone like him.
First of all, if you keep calling it that, no one will take it.
And then second of all, you're not going to have sex with him.
You'll just make him think that you are.
I'll throw him out in the yard, lock the door... ...and all our neighbors will just humiliate him!
You'll definitely get him back.
How do I make him think I want to have sex?
Here's what you do.
Just act like everything around you turns you on.
What do you mean?
Anything can be sexy.
Like this dish towel.
This feels so good against my cheek.
And if I get a little hot, I can just dab myself with it.
Or I can bring it down to my side and run it through my fingers... ...while I talk to him.
I can do that.
Good, good, good.
Get busy.
He's coming.
Hey, what's up?
Could you make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year?
I'd love to.
I love macaroni and cheese.
I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
And I love carrots.
Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers.
Like this.
And hold them down here while I talk to you.
And, you know, if I get really hot...
...I like to pick up this knife.
And I put the cool steel... ...against... ...my body.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
Okay, I'll rest.
But if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
See, that would be impossible to resist if you weren't all... drippy here.
Are you saying that you don't want to get with this?
I don't think you should say that even when you're healthy.
Come on.
Don't take this personally.
I just can't have sex with a sick person.
I'm with you.
I can't have sex with a sick person either.
Disgusting!
But I'm not sick!
Let me prove it to you.
We are two healthy people in the prime of lime.
See, that's the thing, I would like to stay in the "prime of lime."
What is it, honey?
You need some tea?
Some soup?
Calling Dr. Big.
Dr. Big to the bed.
Jeez, honey, I thought you were asleep.
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room?
I was asleep.
No, honey.
You know what's sexy?
Layers.
Layers are sexy.
And blankets are sexy.
And hotwater bottles are sexy.
Get into bed.
I want to prove I'm not sick.
I want to make you feel as good as I feel.
Would you please get some rest?
I'm fine.
Chandler?
I think I'm sick.
Really?
Struck down in the "pribe of libe."
Okay, fine, I admit it.
I feel terrible.
Will you please rub this on my chest?
No, no, no.
You are not getting me this way.
Come on, I really need your help here.
Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
Okay.
So you're just kind of rubbing it on yourself?
Yeah.
It's nice.
You kidding me?
Is this turning you on?
Yes.
Is it the rubbing or the smell?
It's all very, very good.
So you want to go... mix it up?
Not now, I'm sick.
Oh, come on, you big faker!
What about never sleeping with sick people?
Well, that was before all the vaporizing action.
Okay, if you really want to have sex.
Worked like a charm.
Why are you here?
Oh, no, I forgot.
You know what's sadder than this?
Bambi.
I cried for three days with that movie.
No, two.
The third day my mom killed herself, so I was partly crying for that.
Well, that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon.
You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
Yes, it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer.
If this movie's making you guys cry so much, let's just change the channel.
You don't have to be macho all the time.
I'm not macho.
Yeah, you're right.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I just never really cried.
I'm not a crying kind of guy.
Come on, there's gotta be something that gets you choked up.
Like... What if you saw a threelegged puppy?
I'd be sad, sure.
But I wouldn't cry.
What if the puppy said, "Help me, Chandler.
All the other puppies pick on me."
Cry?
I just found a talking puppy.
I'm rich!
I've got it.
I have got it.
Pictures from your childhood.
This'll get you going good.
Oh, what's going on there?
Parents' Day.
First grade.
That's me with the janitor, Martin.
Where are your parents?
They didn't want to come.
Chandler!
Poor thing.
That story doesn't make you cry?
No.
Look, I don't cry.
It's not a big deal, okay?
No!
It's not okay!
It's not okay at all!
You're dead inside!
Excuse me?
Hey, sweetie.
"Chicken Soup for the Soul"?
There's no back to this couch.
You hate this kind of stuff.
I figured I'd give it a shot.
One of the stories may make me cry, then you won't think I'm dead inside.
Oh, that's so sweet.
I don't care if you can't cry.
I love you.
Oh, that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Stop it.
Seriously.
We get married, I'm up at the altar and I'm like this: I won't care.
I know that you'll be feeling it all in here.
Yeah?
Yeah.
And if we have a baby one day... and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room... and you don't cry, so what?
If we take him to college and come home... and we see his empty room for the first time... and you got nothing?
It won't matter to me.
Okay.
I won't worry about this anymore then.
And then, you know, if I die... from a long illness... and you're writing my eulogy... and you open the desk drawer and find a note from me that says: "I will always be with you"... and you still can't shed one tiny tear?
I know you'll be crying a river inside.
I love you.
What is wrong with you?!
I left you a note from the beyond!
So you didn't mean any of that?
Hey uh, is it okay to come in?
Of course!
Oh Joey,  this ring  I...it¡¯s beautiful I love it!
Yeah uh look Rach,   there¡¯s something I gotta tell ya.
Hey!
Hey!
Are you ready to try nursing again?
Yeah!
Hi Emma.
Hey, why do you think she won¡¯t take my breast?
It¡¯s all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it,   but don¡¯t worry.
It¡¯ll happen.
Yowsa!
Okay sweetie, you can do it.
Just open up and put it in your mouth.
Dear Lord.
I¡¯m sorry honey, what were you saying?
Oh uhuh yeah, I think that...  Oh look, she¡¯s pulling away again!
Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth?
She looks scared.
Doesn¡¯t she look scared?
Y¡¯know, I don¡¯t really know her.
Why don¡¯t we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow.
Are you kidding me?!
It¡¯s just so frustrating!
Why doesn¡¯t she want my breast?!
I don¡¯t know!
Maybe she¡¯s crazy!
Oh hey!
Wait up!
Hi!
Congratulations!
I didn¡¯t want to say anything in front of Joey ¡®cause I didn¡¯t know if he knew yet.
What, that we had a baby?
Come on let¡¯s give him a little credit,  although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
No!
No, that you and Rachel are engaged!
What?
Oh, it¡¯s a secret.
Oh goodie!
Yes!
We haven¡¯t done the secret thing in a long time.
Phoebe, there is no secret.
Okay?
I didn¡¯t propose.
Are you lying?
Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?
I am a doctor!
Y¡¯know what?
I¡¯m just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.
All right, me too.
Should we wake her up?No!
No,   come on let her sleep!
She¡¯s so exhausted.
And so engaged.
What?
Oh my God!
Sheshe thinks we¡¯re engaged!
Why?
Why?
Why would she think we¡¯re engaged?!
Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring?
Y¡¯know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.
I didn¡¯t give her that ring!
Really?
No!
So whose ring is it?
It¡¯s mine.
Is it an engagement ring?
Yes!
But you didn¡¯t give it to her?
No!
But you were going to propose?
No!!
Huh, I might be losing interest in this.
Look.
Look, my mom gave me that ring   because she wanted me to propose to Rachel,   but all I wanted to do is if she maybe...  kinda...wanted ah...start...things up again.
Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
Look, I didn¡¯t want to rush into anything.
And it seemed like she didn¡¯t want to either.
But I don¡¯t, I don¡¯t understand how any of this happened!
What?
Did she find the ring in my jacket,    assume that I was going to propose,  throw it on, andand just start telling people?
No!
No, she said you actually proposed to her.
Well I didn¡¯t!
I didn¡¯t propose!
Unless uh...  Did I?
I haven¡¯t slept in forty hours and..  it does sound like something I would do...   Look, we can¡¯t stay in here forever.
Hey, Rach, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
Okay.
What's up, Ross?
So... Thanksgiving.
The holiday season is upon us.
And... you look nice today.
Oh, no.
No, Ross, don't do this.
What?
I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
I thought this might happen today.
I know the holidays can be rough... and it's probably hard for you to be alone right now.
You're alone.
No, I live with Phoebe.
I mean, you're alonealone.
And it's just not the time for us.
I'm sorry.
Oh, well.
Can't blame a guy for trying.
And if anyone needs help pretending to like it...
I learned some things in acting class.
Try rubbing your stomach.
Or saying, "Mmm."
Smiling.
I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
Rachel, there you are.
Let's serve that dessert already!
Joey, you have to stop rushing me.
You don't get any dessert.
Really?
No, just kidding.
I would never do that to you.
Okay, everybody, it's trifle time.
So, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?
It sure is.
Wow.
So did you make it with beef or eggplant?
Beef.
I can't have any.
I don't eat meat.
Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
Really?
Wait, you only got whipped cream.
You gotta take a bite with all the layers.
You dropped a pea.
Well?
It's good.
Really?
How good?
It's so good that I feel selfish... about being the only one who's eating it.
I think we should have everyone taste how good it is.
Especially Ross.
This is so good that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony.
So that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
I've gotta call my friend... and tell her how good this is from Monica's room.
I'll help dial.
I'm gonna go into the bathroom... so I can look at it in the mirror as I eat it.
What was that all about?
Does it not taste good?
Let me try it.
No, no!
All gone!
So good.
Maybe Chandler has some left.
It tastes like feet.
I like it!
Are you kidding?
What's not to like?
Custard, good.
Jam, good.
Meat, good.
So a bird just grabbed it... and then tried to fly away with it... and then just dropped it on the street?
This is my mom and my dad.
What happened back there?
I don't know.
You tell me.
One minute I'm holding Ben, then I've got two kids...
...I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about taxes!
Well, I'm sorry.
I think about stuff.
You're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.
You've planned out the next 20 years.
We've dated for six weeks!
You never think about our future?
I think about whose apartment we'll sleep at tomorrow... ...and where we'll have dinner next Saturday!
I think about whose apartment we'll sleep at tomorrow... ...and where we'll have dinner next Saturday!
I do not think about our children's names!
You know what our children's names will be?
No, I mean, you know.
I read a book, and there was a girl named Emily.
And I thought that might be good.
What book?
The Big Book of Children's Names.
Okay, listen.
What we have is amazing.
But I do not want everything decided for me!
I spent my whole life like that.
It's what I had with Barry.
That's a reason I left.
I like not knowing right now.
Sorry if that scares you, but if you wanna be with me, deal with that!
Okay, fine!
Thank you!
We're not done!
I didn't know that.
You're with a guy who won't stop planning his future with you.
He knows we'll end up together.
If that scares you, tough!
You'll have to deal with that.
I will!
Good, because I love you!
Okay, we can do this now, can't we, Ben?
Yes, we can.
There!
I did it!
I did it!
Look at that!
It stays on and everything.
I'm sorry.
What did you just say?
Did you just say "hi"?
Oh, my God!
Ross?
Ben just said hi!
What?
Ben just said hi!
What, the word "hi"?
No, my Uncle Hi.
Great!
And I missed that too.
I miss everything!
We missed you so much!
Come here, Ben.
Guess what?
Ben just said his first word.
What did he say?
Something about hi.
That's so exciting!
Mommy's so proud of you!
You know, actually, it's more like, hi!
This could go on for a while.
You're right.
We've got a cab waiting.
Well, this was fun.
We should do it again sometime, Ben.
What do you say?
All right, so I've got him...?
Tuesday.
Bye, you guys.
Take care.
Bye, Ben.
Did he just say "bye"?
He said bye!
You said bye!
He said bye to me!
Yes, he did!
Suddenly I'm seeing him go off to college!
We've gotta go.
We've got that cab downstairs.
See you later.
Look at this nice deep hole I dug.
Hey, Bert... ...isn't this a nice hole here?
Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him.
Now, I've looked ahead on the tape, and he does find him again.
But before that happens, there's some rough going for a while.
But I think we can handle it.
And there's just the alphabet, but we know that ends well, so...
Here we go.
Bert?
Bert?
What happened to my friend Bert?
He was here just a moment ago.
Oh, no!
My old friend Bert is lost.
I'm so glad you're here
Hi.
We have a bathroom emergency.
Ben, you know, when you were a baby... ...we'd hang out all the time.
I was your daddy's girlfriend.
But you're not anymore.
No, I'm not.
Because you guys were on a break... Hey, we were not on a... That's fine.
You know what Ben?
One day when you are a lot older, I'm gonna tell you that entire story... ...over a real pitcher of margaritas.
When's my daddy coming back?
Fiftytwo minutes.
So no brothers or sisters, huh?
You know what, I had two sisters and we just tortured each other.
Really?
Like how?
Well, you know, we would... ...we'd repeat everything the other said... ...or we'd jump out of closets to scare each other... ...or switch the sugar with salt so they put salt on their cereal.
That's a good one.
Yeah, you like that one?
Yeah, you're funny.
I'm funny?
Oh, thank God.
Well, hey, I got a ton of these.
You want a good one?
Here's a good one.
You take a quarter... ...and you blacken the edge, right?
And then you say, "I bet you can't roll this quarter... ...to your chin without it leaving your face."
And when they do it, they're left with a line down the center of their face.
Can I do it to you?
I'm funny, Ben, but I'm not stupid.
So did you find anyone to marry you yet?
Uhoh.
Yes.
Ben learned a little trick.
Oh, did he pull the old...?
That's right.
That's right.
Saran wrap on the toilet seat... ...so the pee goes everywhere.
Oh, that.
Yeah, that.
You know I hate practical jokes.
They're mean, they're stupid and I don't want my son learning them.
Saran wrap on the toilet seat?
Isn't that just a little funny?
I was barefoot.
Oh.
Tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him, right?
Yes.
I would love to have a little...
I found him!
Very funny.
Come here.
That is exactly why I've come here to talk to you, okay?
Rachel, you want sugar?
Yes, but... Do I want sugar in my coffee?
No, just some milk would be good, Carol.
Thanks.
Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
"Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?"
Don't do that.
"Don't do that."
Your dad doesn't like pranks.
"Your dad doesn't like pranks."
Oh, damn it!
"Oh, damn it!"
No!
Don't say that.
Damn it!
Go back to repeating.
Damn it!
Oh, crap!
"Oh, crap!"
So now what have we agreed?
No more pranks.
What else?
You and Daddy were not on a break.
Very good.
Rachel, what are you doing here?
I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
Your good friend?
Yeah.
What's her last name?
Carol... ...Lesbian.
Nice.
By the way, that line down my face...  What line?
"What Line?"
The line that prompted a student... ...in my last class of the day to say: "Dude, don't you ever wash your face?"
All right I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged!"
I will be!
I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore.
Okay?
Fine.
Fine.
Once I taught him that stuff, he called me "fun Aunt Rachel."
And I loved being fun Aunt Rachel.
But I'll go back to being boring and uncomfortable Aunt Rachel.
No, it's not what I want.
I'm glad you guys were bonding but... Look, he doesn't have any siblings.
Somebody has to teach him this stuff.
I haven't taught him anything a normal 6yearold doesn't know.
Crap!
I gotta go.
Where can I find Earl?
He's the supply manager here.
I don't know any Earl.
I'm right here!
Earl?
I'm Phoebe.
Phoebe?
The lady who sells toner?
Look, you can't kill yourself.
Look, I really appreciate you coming down... No, I can't let you do it.
Why?
Because, fate made me call you today.
I thought it was toner.
Think about it, okay?
This isn't even my regular job.
My first day, you're my first call.
Somebody else may have hung up, but I wouldn't do that... ...because I know about this stuff.
My mom killed herself.
Really?
How?
I'm not gonna give you tips.
Don't you see that this... ...all came together so I could stop you from doing this?
Couldn't it just be a coincidence?
No, it's fate.
It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate.
Oh, well.
Okay, here's a weird thing.
My mother was also a supply manager.
I'm actually the office manager.
Oh, my God!
So was she!
And get this, okay.
Your name is Earl, right?
Her name was Pearl.
PuhEarl.
Was there anything else?
Sure.
Where're you from?
Philadelphia.
Oh, my God, so was she!
I've got goose bumps.
Really?
I'm wearing layers, and it's warm.
These jerks might not care about you... ...but the universe does, and that says a lot.
Did you hear that?
I don't need you guys to care about me... ...because the universe cares!
The whole universe!
I really wish they'd care a little bit.
You know, I don't think it's you.
Oh, no, it's you.
Yeah.
Oh, this is terrible.
Everything is destroyed.
Look at this.
It meant enough for me to save, and now I can't tell what it is.
It's still soft.
What do you think this is?
I think it was a mouse.
How are you, honey?
How do you think I am?
You've wrecked my childhood memories... ...you love Ross more than me.
And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face.
Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross.
I'm sorry about what happened... ...and I probably can't make it up to you... ...but here's a start.
What's this?
It's the key to my Porsche.
Well, the key to your Porsche.
What?
What?!
I've considered getting rid of it.
I saw my reflection the other day.
Your mother's right, I do look like an ass.
You're giving it to me?
You're kidding.
Well, wait a minute.
A couple of stupid boxes get wet, and she gets a Porsche?
Let's take a drive?
All right!
What about me?
I'm a medical marvel!
I get a Porsche and the Barcalounger's gone?
Give me a box of juice.
Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
Maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
Or this guy's doing so good they want to put more people on it.
This guy goes through two bottles a day now.
What do you care?
You're an actor.
This is your day job.
It's nothing!
I know, but I was the best.
You know?
I liked being the best.
Maybe I should get out of the game.
They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
Say you do that.
Sooner or later, somebody will come along that slices a better cheddar.
Then where you gonna run?
You're right.
I say you show him what you're made of.
Stand your ground.
Show him that you're the baddest Hombre west of the lingerie!
I'm gonna do it!
All right!
Now, go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
Mornin'.
I said, mornin'!
I heard you.
All right, everybody.
I'm opening the doors.
You boys ready?
Ready.
Yeah, I'm ready.
You idiot!
You stupid cowboy!
You've blinded me!
I'm suing!
Oh, my God!
Todd!
What the hell did you do?
Sorry.
I'm such a doofus!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
My God, what happened?
These new kids, they never last.
Sooner or later they all... ...stop lasting.
What do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?
Sure.
I just thought we should hang out.
Oh, wow.
Three hours and still no baby.
The miracle of birthsure is a snoozefest.
Hey, you wanna see something?Sure.
What?
This is gonna be fun.Watch me freak out Chandler.
Honey?Yeah?
Listen, I've been doingsome thinking..   and I don't know whetherit's because we're here..   or Rachel's giving birth..   but I think we shouldtry to have a baby.
Okay.
What's that now?
Okay.
I've been thinking about it too,and I think we're ready.
Are you kidding?
You thinkwe're ready to have a baby now?
This is fun.
You're ready to have a baby?My boy's all grown up!
You said you were ready too.
Yeah, but I was just screwing with youto try to get your voice all high and weird..   Like mine is now!
Okay, then, back off, mister!
Because I am ready to have a baby.
I just want Joey to be the father.
What?
Are you crazy?That's it, right there!
What is going on with you.Since when are you so crazy about babies?
I'm not crazy about babies.I'm crazy about us.
What?
We've always talked about havingbabies someday, not now..   but I'm starting to think that wecan handle it.
We're good.
We're really good.
We are pretty good.
But nothing has to happenuntil you're ready.
Well, maybe I'm ready now.
I mean, it's a little scary,but maybe it's right.
What?
It's not right!We're not ready to have a kid now!
What?I'm kidding.
This is gonna be fun.
So we're gonna try?I mean, we're trying?
We're trying to get pregnant.
I'm not comfortable doingthis in front of the babies.
So when do you want to start trying?All right, hold on a sec.
Period math?Yeah.
Well, we could start trying now.
Right here?No, not here.
Maybe here.
It's perfect.
We got a lot of time to kill,and we're in a building that's full of beds!
I think we found a place.Okay.
Wait.
Wanna set the mood a little?
Hello, Monica.
Not like that.Oh, okay.
We'll dim the lights.Okay.
Or turn them out altogether.
No scented candles.Okay, here.
There we go.
Okay, okay.Making me sterile, but okay.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Oh, wait.Do we have a condom?
Oh, right!
Yes, 98.6.
Should we tell Rachel there's an emptyprivate room right next door to hers?
We could.
Or we could have sex in it.
Well, let me think about thatwhile I remove my pants!
Okay, mister!
Fertilize me!
Does that sound like Janice?
If it's not, then there's two of them.
And that would meanit's the end of the world!
That was amazing.I know.
Hey, do you realize that we may havejust changed our lives forever?
We may have started our family.In nine months we could be here..   having our own baby.
And if not, we got to do iton a bucket.
I hate to be the one to say it..   but, honey, you two are on your own.
The One Where Phoebe Runs I just finished this fascinating book.
By the year 2030, there'll be computers... that can carry out the same amount of functions as a human brain.
So, theoretically, you could download... your thoughts and memories into this computer... and live forever as a machine.
And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
Honey, it was a great idea, nailing the boxes to the floor.
I'd like you to meet Janine.
She's gonna be my new roommate!
And she's gonna live with me!
It's nice to meet you.
Janine...?
Le Croix.
I didn't know that.
What a pretty last name.
So where are you from?
Australia.
I just moved here.
From the land down under?
I didn't know that either!
So what do you do?
I'm a dancer.
You're a dancer?
She's a dancer!
I think I'll go unpack.
Did you interview her before you asked her to move in?
Of course!
What did you ask her?
When can you move in?
Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
Unbelievable.
Down, boy.
Oh, man!
Sorry.
There's just more room out here.
No, you just reminded me that I have to do my stretches too.
Why don't you try to be...?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I didn't want you to touch me... because I'm all sweaty from the workout.
I'm gonna hit the shower.
Oh, my God!
Sorry about that stuff hanging in there.
It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
Oh, yeah, it's me.
All right, all right.
Let's just get this out in the open, okay?
You're hot.
I'm lovable.
Clearly, there's a vibe going on between us.
But we're roommates... and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Imagine living in a supermarket... and you'll understand.
Okay?
So the question is, what do we do?
There isn't anything to do.
I think you're really sweet.
But I'm not interested in you like that.
No, I mean... You're a nice guy, and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend.
I'm just, you know, I just... don't feel that way about you.
I see what happened.
It's because I was trying to repel you.
Right?
Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
I don't think so.
Oh, I do.
How you doing?
I'm okay.
What?
Oh, dear God!
I'm so sorry.
It said that by the year 2030... there'll be computers carrying out the same number of functions... as an actual human brain.
So, theoretically, you could download your thoughts... and your memories into this computer.. And live forever as a machine.
Janine, do you know what we're doing right now?
You and I, we're interfacing.
I gotta go
Hey, you guys.
Is Monica here?
I bought something.
I'm not sure she'll like it.
It may seem crazy, but I've wanted this since I was a little girl.
You bought Shaun Cassidy!
No.
I wish!
Okay, you ready?
Check it out.
What is it?
What the hell is that?
It's a cat.
That is not a cat!
Yes, it is!
Why is it inside out?
Excuse me!
But this is a purebred, showquality sphinx cat.
How much did you pay for that?
It was extravagant, but I got a good deal.
How much?
Thousand bucks.
On a cat?
It's not a cat!
All right.
Listen, ball boys.
My grandma had one when I was little.
It was the sweetest thing.
It would sit in my lap and just purr all day long.
I would drag a string and it would chase it.
Free cats do that too, you know.
It's not a cat!
I'm really excited about this, okay?
I don't care what you think.
I'm gonna set up a litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson.
What am I gonna call her?
Fluffy?
Do you wanna get something to eat, or see how long we can throw this ball?
Check it out.
Almost three hours without dropping it.
Congratulations.
That's quite a waste of time.
You have scratches all over you.
Well, it's my cat.
Oh, I got a cat.
I don't want a cat!
Don't worry, it's not a cat.
You guys, this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat.
It's not sweet.
It's not cute.
I dragged a string, and it flipped out and scratched the hell out of me.
I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me...
...I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
Doesn't sound as crazy as paying $1000 for a cat.
You paid $1000 for a cat when you owe me $300?
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
Oh, good God!
I give up.
I don't know what I'm gonna do with this thing.
Baking it didn't help?
Take it back to where you got it.
I tried.
They won't take her back.
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the Antichrist.
Why won't they take it?
They said they would only give me store credit.
What am I gonna do?
Get 1000 regular cats?
You said it was a show cat.
You can keep it until you find out what to do with it.
That's not the point.
I'm out $1000...
...I'm all scratched up... ...and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
Oh, my God!
The cat's made my eyes water.
Don't throw it to me!
My vision's been compromised!
Oh, God!
Okay.
It's okay.
Man, that was close.
Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
We have great news.
Thank God!
Get your money back?
Yeah, $1500.
You made a profit?
I just came for the red velvet pillow.
There you go.
Thanks, Rachel.
Don't forget, you can come visit her anytime.
Oh, good.
Great.
I'll keep that in mind.
So is this some kind of snake or something?
I like waking up with you.
You're on.
Oh, good.
Okay, hi.
Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Thanks.
Hi.
I want to start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year.
I made a man with eyes of coal And a smile so bewitchin ' How was I supposed to know That my mom was dead in the kitchen?
My mother's ashes Even her eyelashes Are resting in a little yellow jar And sometimes when it's freezing I feel a little sneezy And now I.
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
Noisy boys.
Is it something you'd like to share with the group?
No, that's okay.
If it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear.
That guy's going home with a note.
I was just saying.
Could you speak up?
Sorry.
I was saying you were the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.
And you said Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen.
And I said I liked her in Splash, but not in Wall Street.
I thought she had a hard quality.
A hard quality.
And while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way you are luminous with a kind of delicate grace.
Then that's when you started yelling.
Okay, we're gonna take a short break.
I think that guy's going home with more than a note.
But you can't actually test this theory.
Because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.
All right.
I have a question then.
Were you planning on kissing me ever?
That's definitely a valid question and the answer would be yes.
Yes, I was.
But see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment because it's you.
Sure.
Right.
But the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be.
And now, it's just got to be one of those things where I sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it.
And I'm not really a sweeping sort of fella.
Oh, David, I think you are a "sweeping sort of fella. "
I mean, you're a sweeper trapped inside a physicist's body.
Really.
I'm sure of it.
You should just do it.
Just sweep and throw me.
Now?
Right now.
Just.
You know what?
This is just really expensive.
And this was a gift.
Now you're just tidying up.
Okay, what the hell?
I wanted this to work so much.
You'll do what?
If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is.
Oh my God!
If I have to I'll, I'll do all again, I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing, I'll go to the P.T.A.
Meetings, I'll coach the soccer team.
Really?
Yeah, if I have to.
Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.
You're the most wonderful man.
And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'
But you're not.
Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say.
I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.
God.
I love you.
I know you do.
Me too.
So what now?
I guess we just keep dancing.
Where is she, Where is she?
Rachel is a very lucky girl
All right, well, I'd better go.
I think that would be best.
Yeah.
I'll talk to you later.
Okay.
But not about this.
No, never.
Never!
Bye.
No touch.
No touch.
Just brought back your videos.
Hey, Ross.
Look, I think we need to talk about before.
No.
No, we don't.
Yes, we do.
Now, look.
That was the best nap I ever had.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Come on, admit it.
That was the best nap you ever had.
I've had better.
Okay.
When?
All right!
All right!
It was the best nap ever!
I said it, okay?
But it's over, Joey!
I want to do it again.
We can't do it again.
Why not?
Because it's weird!
Fine.
You want a drink?
Sure.
What do you got?
Warm milk and Excedrin PM.
Boy, I tell you.
That judging stuff took a lot out of me.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
Why would I care about that?
No reason.
I'm just saying that... ...that's where I'll be.
As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself.
What do you say, 6:30, my place?
Okay, that did not just happen.
Here comes a camera.
Right.
No biggie.
Stay loose.
Why do they keep doing that?
We have to get up on one of those platforms.
They've been taping them all day.
Right.
What'd you guys do to get up on there?
We learned how to dance.
When you learned to dance, did you forget how to put on underpants?
Yeah!
Hey, you're a good dancer.
If Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them jealous... then who's gonna be the losers then?
I know what'll get us up on a platform.
What?
The routine!
We haven't done the routine since middle school.
When the snippy guy sees the routine... he'll want to build us our own platform.
Was it that good?
We got honorable mention in the brother/sister dance category!
It's almost fake midnight.
Do we really have any other choice?
Okay, let's do it.
Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
Five, six, seven, eight!
So do we really need to ask who's going up on the platform next?
You get up there and do that again, exactly like that.
Get this.
Dick will want it for the Bloopers show.
All right, cut!
Listen up, everyone!
When we start again, it'll be the countdown... so I want to see everybody's excitement!
Hey, guy!
You got three seconds to get away.
What's going on here?
Take a look at the guy's pants!
You told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went overboard?
Yeah, take a hike, wet pants!
Can you believe this?
We're on the platform for the millennial moment!
I know!
You haven't been practicing the routine, have you?
No.
Me too!
When the music starts...
I was thinking about maybe going into the robot.
Ross, we should stick to the routine.
We don't want to look stupid.
All right, we're back!
Ten seconds left.
Ten.
Nine, eight.
Seven.
Okay, it all comes down to this.
Whatever happens, happens.
Destiny.
three, two, one!
Cut!
No!
Year!
Happy "No" Year!
Now we go to the live shot of Times Square.
I may have boogied right into first place.
Oh, my God!
David!
Is this a bad time?
No, it's a great time!
Come in!
Wow!
Hi!
Oh, my gosh!
What are you doing here?
Are you back from Minsk?
Just for a couple of days.
I'm here to explain to the people who gave us our grant..   why it's a positive thing that we've spent all their money..   and accomplished nothing.
Who cares?
It got you here.
It got me to New York.
Then I got in a cab at the airport..   and the guy said, "Where to?"
I just gave him your address.
I didn't even think about it.
Where's your luggage?
Damn it.
All right, I'll call the cab company.
We can call them later.
Can you just stand there for a moment?
Boy.
There's an old Russian expression that goes:   Roughly translated, that means:   "This thing that I'm looking at: Wow."
Thank you.
You should see me when.. Actually, no, I look pretty good.
Are you kidding?
You know, when you don't see someone for a long time..   you build them up in your head, you start thinking:   "Come on, don't be crazy, nobody's that beautiful."
But, well, you are.
Well, so are you seeing anyone?
It's two on each cheek..    and one on the lips.
Well, if that's what they do in Minsk.
In New York, it's..   Oh, boy.
No, I can't.
I can't do this.
It's bad.
But it's nice.
And nice is good.
And good is not bad.
Ergo, we should keep kissing.
No, no.
No.
But..   Ergo.
Look, David, if you had never left, then..   yeah, we'd probably still be together right now.
But you did leave.
And I'm with Mike and I really care about him.
Okay.
Well, he's very lucky.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
The key works.
Hi, Mike.
And, you, thanks for the face massage!
Thank you!
So how many guys have your key?
It's not as bad as it looks.
I was saying goodbye to an old friend.
Your lipstick's on his mouth.
We just happen to wear the same shade.
No, David and I did used to go out.
But years ago.
And he lives in Minsk.
He's only in town for a couple days.
Did you..?
No.
No.
Kiss him?
Oh, well, yeah.
Yes, but.. Look, she really likes you.
In fact, she stopped what was a pretty amazing kiss.
I don't think you realize just how lucky you are, fella.
Don't point your finger at me!
Why?
What are you gonna do about it?
Well, I'll show you what I'm gonna do about it.
Oh, really?
Really?
You want some of that?
Here, David, you should just go.
All right.
But if I ever do come back from Minsk, well, you just better watch out.
If I go to Minsk, you better watch out.
Oh, you're going to Minsk?
Well, I might.
Really?
Well, if you do, come in the spring.
It's just lovely there.
I've heard that, actually.
Okay, well, guys?
Goodbye, Phoebe.
Bye.
Hey, what, are you kidding me?
Righto.
Righto.
Take good care of her.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
If you want your key back, I totally understand.
It's never gonna happen again, right?
Right.
Never.
I swear.
I just want to say, if you do ever come to Minsk, that's my number.
We'll party up Vladnikstyle.
Yeah!
Ooh!
We'll say that we were mugged.
You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged.
Good, that's good.
But you don't look like you were mugged.
No.
If I could just get in there and make a facetoface apology,  you know, look 'em in the eye, I know can I get 'em to forgive us.
I don't know...
I'm telling you...
I can do it.
Yeah, he can do it.
It all looks so beautiful.
The turkey, the stuffing...
The cranberries.
Enough!
A monkey could've made 'em!
Hey, listen, guys, we feel really terrible.
He's doing that weird eyecontact thing.
Don't look at him.
Don't look at him.
Come on, you guys.
We want you to know we're very, very sorry.
Right, guys?
I feel terrible.
So sorry.
But let's not ruin this day.
You've worked so hard.
Let's move past this, and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?
The floating heads do make a good point.
Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.
So bad.
So bad.
So bad.
Okay.
Okay, you two go get the dessert, and I'll let you in.
Dessert?
Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies.
You did remember, right?
Pies.
Oh, we thought you said "prize."
Here.
Grand supreme little darling?
Congratulations!
Oh, my god, you forgot the pies?!
Well, I can't believe this!
You forced me to make dinner, then you're an hour late,  and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do!
Really, girls, not cool.
I have to get that.
Now, when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone.
Thanksgiving is over!
The vein has spoken!
It's really starting to hurt.
Okay, look, I'm...
I'm going to pull on the door,  and you guys push as hard as you can.
Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay?
Okay, so push!
Just a sec.
We're kind of in the middle of something here.
Oh!
Stop putting things down my pants!
Come on, guys, push!
Yeah, come on!
Push!
Push!
Push!
My cranberries!
Oh, man, I got food all over me!
Ah!
I can't believe what you did!
Monica's going to kill you!
Look, look, look what the... look what...  look what the floating heads did!
I don't care.
What's going on?
That was the adoption agency.
And...?
We're getting a baby!
This thanksgiving kicks last thanksgiving's ass!
To Monica and Chandler ...  and the knocked up girl in Ohio.
Cheers!
I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
I know.
Have you considered pagaenting?
I can't believe they called and we are actually getting a baby.
I know how you feel.
Really?
Sure.
I went the exact same thing with Alicia May Emory.
The waiting and wondering.
Then one day I get that call from Toysrus  She was in stock.
That is the exact same thing
This must have brought back some bad memories for you, Ross.
Why?
Ross was mugged as a kid.
You were?
Yeah.
And it was pretty traumatic.
It was outside St. Mark's Comics.
I was minding my business, seeing what kind of trouble SpiderMan was into.
Wonder Woman.
Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery..   to pick up a couple of dozen linzer tortes for someone..   when out of nowhere, this thug with a pipe jumps out and says:    "Give me your money, punk!"
Oh, my God.
I know.
And the worst part was, they took my backpack..   which had all the original artwork I did for my own comic book, Science Boy.
Oh, yeah!
What was his super power again?
A superhuman thirst for knowledge.
I better get to class.
Are there any more of your friends I should look out for?
No.
Actually, you might want to stay away from Jane Street.
That's where Stabby Joe works.
I think we have a problem here.
What?
Back in my mugging days, I worked St. Mark's Comics.
Yeah?
A pipe was my weapon of choice..   and preteen, comicbook nerds were my meat.
So?
There was one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said:    "Geology rocks!"
"Geology rocks!"
Oh, my God!
I know!
Hey.
How was class?
No one asks me that.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I really want to know.
Oh.
Well, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene..   All right, nothing is worth this.
I have a confession to make.
Okay, you know that girl that mugged you when you were a kid?
What are you talking about?
It wasn't a girl.
It was this huge dude.
He had a pitchfork and a sword.
You don't have to lie anymore.
I know that it was a 14yearold girl.
No, it wasn't.
Yes, it was.
You don't think I would have defended myself against a 14yearold..?
"Give me your money, punk!"
Oh, my God, it was you!
I can't believe it.
You mugged me?
Yeah.
And I'm so, so sorry, Ross.
I'm sorry.
But, you know, if you think about it, it's kind of neat.
I mean, well, it's just that I've always felt kind of like an outsider.
You know, the rest of you have connections that go way back..   and, you know, now you and I have a great one.
It's not the best!
I know.
Please forgive me.
I don't know what to say.
There's nothing you can say!
That was the most humiliating thing ever.
Even more humiliating than..  Let's not do this!
And then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hot tub..   and start making out with each other.
Hey, Ross.
I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a sec?
Sure, go ahead.
Oh, sorry.
Sure, go ahead.
I just really wanted to apologize again.
And also show you something I think you'll find very exciting.
Oh, my God!
"Crap from the street!"
Look, Ross.
In this box..   are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell..   or smoke.
Anyway, I was looking through it, and I found..   Science Boy.
Oh, my God!
I never thought I'd see this again.
It's all here!
What made you save it all these years?
I guess I just thought it was really good.
And maybe it would be worth something one day.
You really thought Science Boy was worth saving?
Yeah.
But you should know I also have a jar of Vaseline and a cat skull in here.
Still, this is amazing!
Oh, my God.
Thank you, Phoebe.
You're welcome.
Thank you for Science Boy.
I learned a lot from him.
You're welcome.
Wait a minute.
All right, buddy.
Time to roll over.
You are going to a clinic!
You're going to a clinic!
And a pajama store!
Your name, please?
Joey Tribbiani.
Did you stay up all night in preparation for your study?
Sir?
Yes, he did.
All right.
We'll call you in a few minutes.
Check out that girl.
She's really hot.
Yeah, she is.
How you doing?
You looking good.
What?
You're coming on to the entire room.
I'm Chandler.
I'm Marjorie.
Do you mind if I sit?
Please.
So what are you in for?
I talk in my sleep.
What a coincidence!
I listen in my sleep.
So why don't you give me your number?
Are you ready?
Hello, little ones.
So, is Joey going to stop snoring?
Yep!
And a beautiful woman agreed to go out with me.
Joey wanted to ask her out, but, you know, she picked me.
How'd that happen?
Because I'm cooler.
No, seriously.
She's the kind of girl... Joey was unconscious.
Hey, you guys!
What's happening?
Oh, my God!
What is that?
They gave it to me at the sleep clinic... ...and it's going to help me not to snore.
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe?
You don't have to wear it unless you are.
I know I don't have to.
It tastes good.
Plus, you look cool.
Late.
Dude, I am trying to sleep

You don't feel that now.
It was crazy.You're fine.
You're better than fine.
You are, as your friend Tonywould say, "Great!"
Everything's normal.She's just your friend, Rachel.
Your friend, Rachel.Your friend.
Rachel.
Hi, sweetie.Hey, it's your girlfriend, Rachel!
Boy, do I have a surprise for you.
Sex on the balcony?
No.
But someone's not gonnaget over that idea.
What is it?I drew you a bath.
I don't like baths.
Could you draw mea picture of us having sex on the balcony?
Please.
Will you just try it for me.I used all my best stuff.
I lit candles, I put on music.I used bath salts, plus bubble bath.
And got you this little plasticNavy ship!
So it's a boy bath.
This does butch it up a bit.I swear, if you try it, you will love it.
If I do this, can we at least discusssex on the balcony?
Absolutely.
But I know howthat discussion's gonna go.
All right, this isn't so bad.I like the flowery smell.
Which is okay,because I've got my boat.
I can actually feel my tensionjust melting away.
So?Oh, my God.
I told you you were a bath person.Hey, maybe I can give you a facial.
I'm gonna need a bigger boat.
I'm in the bathroom.
Can you come in here?I think there's something wrong.
You know what?I think I'll wait out here.
I'm in the bathtub.
What's wrong?I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong.
The water's tepid, the salt didn't dissolveand is now lodged places.
And the scents I used don't complimenteach other.
Eucalyptus and chamomile?
What?Bath salts.
They're starting to effervesce.
It's different.
It's interesting.
Okay.
Let's talk about something else.
Yeah.
Sure.
Joey, I know.What?
I know.What?
I know about your feelings.Oh, my God, you do?
I'm sorry.
Things worked out forChandler and Monica, but that's rare.
I know.
And this is so much morecomplicated than it was for those guys.
I mean, it's Rachel, for God's sakes.
For God's sakes, it's Rachel!
I know!
She's not only my friend,she's my pregnant friend.
She's my pregnant friendwho's Ross 'ex!
Yeah, that's Rachel.
Beat me over the head with it.
What am I gonna do?
I keep tryingto get rid of these feelings.
I stayed up all last night and made a listof everything I don't like about her.
You wanna hear it?Yeah.
"She made me switch to light mayo.
"That's it!
That's all I got!
You know what?
Tastes the sameand my pants fit better.
Joey, I think you're getting upset fornothing.
This is probably just a crush.
You think?
Absolutely.
You get this rushof feelings, but then it goes away.
Yeah, just a crush.That's all this is.
It's a crush!
I'm Joey.
I don't get deep feelings.
There you go.Crushes happen all the time.
I know I've had them for all you guys.Except for Ross and Chandler.
And I'm sure you've had them for us.Not really.
Throw me a bone here.
So I called the doctor.
Wanna hand over your money now?
That way, we don't have to go through the formality of playing.
No, that's fine.
We'll see who has the last laugh, monkey boy.
Are we done with the chit chat?
Ready for serious poker?
You guys, look!
The oneeyed Jack follows me wherever I go.
Right, okay.
Serious poker.
Excuse me.
Where are you going?
To the bathroom.
Do you wanna go to the bathroom or play poker?
I wanna go to the bathroom.
Well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
I'm waiting to hear from that job.
The store closes at 9.
You can eat then.
That's fine.
I'll just have a Tic Tac to hold me over.
Cincinnati.
No blinds.
Everybody ante.
Yes!
Or no!
Your money's mine, Greene.
Your fly's open, Geller.
You know what I just realized?
"Joker" is "poker" with a "J" !
Coincidence?
That's "joincidence" with a "C" !
Yeah, I'm out.
I'm in.
Me too.
Me too.
What do you got?
You better hop out of the shower, because I got a flush.
Well, well, well!
Hop back in, bucko, because I got four 6s!
I got four 6s!
I won!
I actually won!
Oh, my God!
You know what?
I'm gonna make a little Ross pile.
I think that one was Ross' .
And I think that one was Ross' .
Well, I have got your money And you'll never see it And your fly's still open I made you look I'm in.
I couldn't be inner.
Monica, in or out?
I hate this game!
Okay, Joey, your bet.
I fold, like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face.
I'm out.
I'm very in.
Couldn't be more out.
Me too.
I will see you and I'll raise you.
Do you wanna waste another buck?
No, not this time.
What did you have?
I'm not telling.
Come on, show them.
Get your hands out of there!
I've had dates like this.
Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you?
Your whole face is getting red.
Little veins popping out of your temple.
Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
I'm not losing.
Just deal the.
You are definitely losing.
Rachel Greene.
Excuse me.
It's about the job!
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
Well, yeah.
Oh, wow!
I mean, wow.
I think she's cute, but...
I never would've thought of going out with her.
Never!
Really?
But after you said it's okay, I figured, "Why not?"
Oh, so not really "never."
I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am.
I mean, after all we've been through.
I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.
If you ever date Monica, you have my blessing.
And mine.
Chandler?
Why are you here?
This is where Ross and I are meeting for our date.
So, what do you think?
I don't like it.
Really?
It's kind of slutty.
It's yours.
Yeah, well, I'm a slut.
Me too.
Hi, Jill.
Hi... Rachel.
You're not at home, you're right here.
Yeah, I know.
And I bet you thought it would be weird.
But it's not.
Okay.
So, well, I'll...
I'll have her home by midnight.
Why aren't you home yet?
Is someone there?
Oh, yeah, it's me.
Sorry.
What are you doing here?
I'm just looking out your window... at the view.
What are you guys doing?
We got some vapor rub in some places.
He brought her back to his apartment.
Who?
Is that your sister?
She is a slut!
Ross is on a date with your sister.
How weird is that?
Oh, my God, he's taking off her clothes!
He's taking off her coat.
Oh, this is just terrible.
Oh, no, it's not.
It's a first date.
I'm sure that nothing is gonna...
He's gonna get some.
Of the glare... from the streetlight out of his apartment.
You know, so he's closed the drapes there... so he can have a nice, pleasant... conversation with your little sister.
Well, I'm off to bed.
I don't feel good.
You better not get me sick.
What are you gonna do
Want to go in the bedroom?
It's a little more comfortable.
Sure.
Okay.
Oh, wait, did you send those contracts to Milan?
If this is your idea of sexy talk... Did you overnight the contracts I gave you?
What contracts?
Please tell me this is just one of your jokes that I don't get.
Like what?
Like the thing when you put the phone in your pants?
Tag, I'm serious.
This isn't funny.
Those contracts had to go out today.
You didn't give me any contracts.
Yes, I did.
I put a little Postit on it that said: "Must go out today," and I underlined "today" three times.
Then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn't wanna seem too bossy.
You never gave them to me.
If we went to the office, you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
No, I'd see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk.
Maybe I'd look embarrassed because you're talking on the phone with your crotch.
You want to go to the office now?
Come on, it's late.
We're not going down to the office.
Yeah, I understand.
I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.
All right, get your coat!
Oh!
When did you unhook this?
Nice work!
Feel free to look... ...but I'm telling you, those contracts are not on this desk.
How could you possibly know?
Look at this mess, Tag.
This is what I'm talking about.
You have to be more organized.
You've got newspapers, you've got magazines, you... Oh!
And who's this chippy?
A little young for you, but whatever.
That's my sister.
Really?
Very cute braces.
Anyway, you know what?
The point is, Tag, start looking... ...because you're gonna find those contracts on your desk.
So when do you imagine you gave them to me?
Morning or afternoon?
In the afternoon.
Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch... ...he put them on my desk, and then I put a Postit on it... ...that said: "Must go out today."
So you just keep looking in there, all right?
They're not here.
Puzzler.
Bit of a puzzle.
Why don't you check the copy room.
Maybe you left the contracts in there.
How could I have left them there?
I don't know.
How can your genitals make phone calls?
Okay?
It's not a perfect world.
Just go, please?
Fine.
Thank you.
Hello?
I still don't get it.
I got you some coffee to...
So you got anything for me?
Still no luck.
Oh, my God.
You checked your entire desk and all the drawers?
Want me to check again?
I wish you would.
Well, no, it's not in there.
How about that drawer?
Well, it's not out here.
Any chance it could be in your office?
I don't know.
I mean, let me check.
Any luck?
See you in my office for a minute?
You found them!
I'm not even gonna gloat.
I'm just really relieved that this whole...  You put these on my desk.
I did not.
Oh, really?
They slid out of your bottom drawer... ...crawled across the floor, then jumped onto my desk?
How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
I am so hot for you right now.
I read a lot  Just when I thought we could be friends   Hey Rach, I just heard.
I'm so sorry  Oh, thank you...  You still don't know my name, do you?
Well, now I don't have to  Ross, what is taking you so long?
I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!
Rachel?
Mark?
Oh my God!
How've you been?
I'm fantastic.
You remember Ross?
Sure, sure.
What's with the chair  Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so...
Clever.
So how are you?
Oh, well, you're not catching me on my best day  Yeah, a box full of your desk stuff doesn't exactly say big promotion  No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work  Are you sure, because we may have something at Louis Vuitton  Well, screw charity work.
What've you got?
Why don't we have dinner tonight and talk about it?
Great!
I'll call ya!
Nice to see you  Yeah!
yeah, I got tenure!
Oh my God!
See?
I told you something good would come along  And he seemed really nice.
I've met him before?
Ross!
That's Mark.
From Bloomingdales?
You were insanely jealous of him  That is Mark?
I hate that guy  No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him  What?
You don't want me to get a job?
Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job.
Maybe make you his SEXretary  I'm serious.
I just don't trust that guy, okay?
Ross, you know what?
Okay, let's talk about it later, there comes security   Oh, I love this street.
Hey, is Rachel here?
No  She's still at dinner?
I guess.
Why?
Who's she with?
That guy Mark.
From Bloomingdale's...  She thinks he's just being nice to her.
But I know he really wants to sleep with her  It's seven years ago.
My time machine works!
We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her  But I know he just wants to get into her pants  So what if he wants to sleep with her?
I mean, she's single and he's cute  Excuse me?
Oh please!
Yesterday on the subway?
You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.
For your information, I was staring at her baby.
We're about to be parents  Oh, sorry!
Hi you guys!
Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?
Oh, it was great.
Mark is so sweet.
Oh yeah?
Yeah?
I wonder why?
What could that smarmy letch possibly want?
Oh Ross, come on.
He's happily married His wife just had twins  Should we send something?
How did the job stuff go?
He offered me one   That's great!
Congratulations!
I know, it's amazing.
It's amazing.
It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren.
The money is great...  Can we, can we just stop for a second?
Who said something better would come along, huh?
You didn't believe me  I told you everything was gonna work out.
You know what?
This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
The job is in Paris   I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am I missing opportunities?
I don't know... You know what?

Taste it.
Yeah, it's fat.
I drank fat!
I know, I did that two minutes ago.
Hey, Mr. Tux.
Why aren't you dressed?
We have a halfhour.
That was four minutes ago.
We have to be out the door at 7:40.
Relax, we'll be ready.
It takes us two minutes to get dressed.
I'd feel better if you got dressed now.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, look at you.
All sexy.
Really?
How come you didn't come over earlier?
Because I'm a stupid, stupid man.
Hey, Ross, want some cider?
No.
So you're pretty close, huh?
Makeup's on.
Hair's done.
I just have to get dressed.
And that takes what, six or seven minutes?
Yeah.
Once I figure out what I'm wearing.
Glass of fat?
The One Where No One's Ready What's the matter?
You nervous about your speech?
Nope.
You wanna hear it?
Am I in it?
After I thank everyone for giving to the museum...
...I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey.
Hello!
You look great!
Thank you.
I know, though.
You see this?
This is a person who is ready to go.
Phoebe, you... You are my star.
Well, you're my lucky penny.
All right, I took the quiz.
And it turns out I do put career before men.
Get up.
What?
You're in my seat.
How is this your seat?
Because I was sitting there.
But you left.
Well, it's not like I went to Spain.
I went to the bathroom.
You knew I'd be back.
What's the big deal?
Sit somewhere else!
The big deal is I was sitting there last!
So... ...it's my seat.
Well, actually, the last place you were sitting was in there, so... You guys, you know what?
It doesn't matter.
You both have to go get dressed before the big vein in my head pops.
I just have to do one thing.
It's not a big deal.
Get up!
Phoebe, you look great!
All right already.
Are you gonna do magic?
That's funny.
Change.
I just got in.
I don't care.
It starts at 8.
We can't be late.
He could not, would not, want to wait.
Our table is in front.
My boss will be there.
Everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
Has somebody been drinking my fat?
Does this look like something a paleontologist's girlfriend would wear?
I don't know.
You might be the first one.
Rach, did you check the machine?
No.
Wait.
This is the outfit that makes my calves look fat.
Never mind.
Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today.
It's called, "Get up!"
I wish there was something I could do to help you.
All right.
You can have the chair.
Really?
Oh, my.
Would you look at that?
I have to tie my shoes, so you go ahead.
I'll catch up.
Come on, that's not running!
Let's go!
I'm telling you, when she runs... she looks like Kermit the Frog... and the Six Million Dollar Man.
Monica had such a crush on him.
She used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
I used to do that too!
Did you also have his album, "It's Not Easy Being Green"?
Oh, Mon.
So Phoebe runs weird, huh?
Yeah.
And I know she'll want to run again.
I don't know how to get out of it.
I mean, I live with her.
Why don't you be straight with her?
Tell her the truth.
You're right.
I should just tell her the truth.
Phoebe, Monica tripped me.
I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
But we were having so much fun.
I don't know.
Rachel, I'm sorry I hurt your ankles.
Ankle.
We'll see.
Oh, yeah, it's me.
I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out.
You lied so you could run by yourself.
No, Phoebe, no.
I was...
I was actually just checking... to see... if I could run.
And I can!
Please, I'm not an idiot.
No, wait.
Phoebe?
Wow.
I'm never gonna find love again.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Sure.
Phoebe, I just wanted to say I'm sorry, okay?
I handled the situation horribly.
And I should not have lied to you.
So what should you have done?
I should have told you the truth.
Which is?
Well, the reason I didn't want to go running with you is... because... the way that you run is just a little...
So?
It's embarrassing.
People were looking at us like we were crazy.
Why do you care?
Because they're people!
People you don't know and will never see again.
Yes, but still they are people... with eyes.
I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss...
But okay.
I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you.
Okay.
You're uptight.
What?
I am not uptight.
I am not uptight, man.
That's okay.
I'm not judging you.
That's just who you are.
I'm more free, you know.
I run like I did when I was a kid... because that's the only way it's fun, you know?
Didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs would fall off... Like when you were running towards the swings or running away from Satan?
The neighbor's dog.
Is this in the right place?
You and I, we're interfacing.
I gotta go
Who are you?
Oh, hi, I'm Joey.
My stupid friends are buying this house.
Who are you?
I'm Mackenzie.
My stupid parents are selling this house  I hate my parents  I hate my friends  Alright, look.
There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening  Like what?
Uhm... oh!
Okay.
You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!
What are you?
Eight?
Woah, uh!
Okay, let's hear your great idea  I don't have any great ideas.
I am eight.
Ahh!
There's gotta be a way.
I mean, you know,  if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike  That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?
I really don't  What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends  My parents say I'm gonna make new friends  Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young.
Me, I'm set in my ways  This is what my mom was talking about  Whiners are wieners  Look, you want your friends to be happy, right?
Yeah, yeah, I guess  Well, if moving here is gonna make them happy, don't you want them to do it?
Yeah, maybe  Then you gotta let them go  I hate to admit it, but you're probably right.
How did you get to be so smart?
I read a lot  Just when I thought we could be friends   Hey Rach, I just heard.
Okay, let's talk about it later, there comes security   Oh, I love this street.
The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences  Man, those two dogs are going at it!
Hey!
Hey, where have you been?
Oh, just er... you know, looking around.
But you know what?
This house... is great.
Really?
What changed your mind?
Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing  Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago   What?
Ha!
I'm just messing with you.
That's not funny!
You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!
Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room  What?
I get my own room?
You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
Oh my God!
Oh!
Hey, can I have an aquarium?
And a sex swing?
No!
Why not?
I'll keep the tank clean   After you, miss Banana Hammock  Thank you, mister Bag.
The job is in Paris   I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am I missing opportunities?
You know, I've always thought of myself as a serious actor  I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies?
I don't know... You know what?
I'm gonna put you on with my bear.
Hold on.
Hey bear, I need some career advic
Hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs.
You have been maid of honor before?
You see?
This is exactly why you shouldn't lie.
That's it.
I am maid of honor.
No, I am.
How come you are?
Because I cared enough to lie.
Hey, I could help you decide who should do it.
We could have an audition.
See how you'd handle maidofhonortype situations.
What do you mean?
When I want a job...
...I audition and if I'm the best of the people they see...
...I get the part.
So, okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
Oh, me and Ross can be the judges.
It's better than us deciding.
Oh, this is crazy.
Can't we just flip a coin?
No, coins hate me.
Okay, fine.
You know what?
We will let Ross and Joey decide.
Hi!
Ross, sweetie.
Hey there, handsome thing.
Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Giorgio.
Okay, we'll give you hypothetical maidofhonor situations.
You'll be scored on a scale of one to ten.
One being the highest.
Ten is the highest.
Why is 10 the highest?
Because it's the highest.
Okay, Rachel, you're up first.
Situation number one: You're with Monica.
The wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet.
Go!
I don't want to marry Chandler.
I've got cold feet.
It's gonna be okay.
One man the rest of my life?
I don't know.
This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey.
Look, Monica... ...getting cold feet is very common.
It's just because of all the anticipation.
And you just have to remember that you love Chandler.
And also, I ran out on a wedding.
You don't get to keep the gifts.
Drawing on your own experience.
Very good.
Yes, very nice, Rachel.
Thank you, judges.
Kiss ass.
Oh.
Okay, Phoebe.
Yes, Your Honor.
We're now in the ceremony.
Monica is about to say, "I do"... ...when her drunk uncle starts yelling.
What do you do?
Go!
When Monica was a little girl...
...I remember that... Ow!
Very good!
Oh.
Yes, excellent.
Perfect score.
She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
Hey, you want a little taste of Pheebs?
It is time for you to give your maidofhonor speech.
We haven't even prepared... Go!
Okay, okay, okay.
Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as...
Okay, no!
Forget that!
That sucks!
Okay, never mind.
Forget it.
I met...
I met Monica when we were just a couple of 6yearolds... ...and became friends with Chandler when he was 25... ...although he seemed like a 6yearold.
Oh.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I've known them separately and together.
To know them as a couple is to know that you are in the presence of love.
So I would like to raise my glass... ...to Monica and Chandler... ...and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together.
I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
Wow.
Great speech.
Yeah, it really was.
Oh, thanks.
Okay, Phoebe, I guess you're next.
Although I really don't see the point.
Okay.
I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married.
I remember talking about this day with Rachel... ...while we were showering together, naked.
And she's back in the game!
Julie.
Hey, where is Rachel?
She and Pheobe took the stripper to the hospital.
Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
What?
When was this?
1987.
The weekend you guys visited me at school.
Oh my god.
That is wild.
Yeah, but it is like millions years ago.
So doesn't matter.
No, it matters to me.
why?
Because the night you kissed Rachel was  the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time,  You kissed that night too?
Two guys at one night.
Oh, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.
Seriously where did this happen?
Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room,  I went in there to make sure she was all right.
She was lying on my bed ... uhm all buried in people's coats.
Well, I went to kiss on the forehead.But it was so dark I accidently got her lips.
I started to pull away but then I felt her start kiss me back.
It's only for second, but it was amzaing.
Now that I found you kissed her first.
Wait, what bed you said she was on?
Mine.
I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
No, she was definitely on my bed.
Why would kiss a girl and put her on your bed?
And then who was on my bed?
Oh, Oh Oh ...  No, No, No  Yes!!
You were under the pile of coats?
I was the pile of coats!
Oh my god!
You were my midnight mystery kisser?
You were my first kiss with Rachel?
You were my first kiss ever?
What did I marry into
I don't know.
Whatever I was feeling, I'm... ...not.
But you guys came so close.
I'm sorry.
You'll have to get used to the fact... ...that I will not be dating Ross.
Here he is.
Guys, this is Russ.
Hey, Ross.
Hi, Russ.
I've got two more tables to clean, and then we'll go.
I'll just sit here and... ...chat with your... ...friendtype people.
Rachel?
So, you know what you're doing, right?
Waitressing?
Well, yeah.
But, no.
I mean...
Doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?
Bob Saget?
Oh, yeah!
No, no, no!
Oh, my, oh!
What's wrong?
She's upset because... ...she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
All right.
Listen, Pheebs.
This is gonna be okay.
Ross, Russ.
Russ, Ross.
Are you a friend of Rachel's?
Yes.
Yes, I am.
Are you a friend of Rachel's?
Actually, I'm kind of a... ...you know... ...a datetype thing... ...of Rachel's.
A date?
I'm her date.
Oh!
Oh, you're a... Oh, you're the date.
This is actually good... ...because if we lose Ross, we have a spare.
Oh!
You are the paleontologist.
Yes.
Yes, I am.
And you are a... Periodontist.
See?
Now they're as different as night and... ...later that night.
Well, I am going to get a beverage.
It was nice meeting you.
Ditto.
Well, I met Russ.
Hey, I didn't know we were seeing other people.
Well, we're not seeing each other, so... For your information, there's a woman at the museum... ...who's curator of moths and other... ...winged things... ...who's let it be known that she is drawn to me, much like a... ...you know.
I've kept her at bay, but if this is the deal This is the deal.
Okay, well, have a nice evening.
Russ, you ready?
We're having some fun now, huh, Ross?
Wanna do another one?
Huh, Russ?
Eleven letters... ...atomic element number 101, ends in "ium."
Dysprosium.
Try mendelevium.
And weenie number two has it.
Unless "Knights in White Satin" was sung by the Doody Blues.
You don't see it?
You actually don't see it?
What?
Honey, you're dating Ross.
No, Pheebs, I'm dating Russ.
Russ is Ross.
Russ, Ross.
Steve, sleeve.
No one is named sleeve.
What are you talking about?
Other than their names being similar, I do not see what you're seeing.
For your information... ...it's a card sharp, not a card shark.
You could not be more wrong.
You could try, but you would not be successful.
I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eyepoking begins.
I know your problem.
Oh, you do, do you?
You're jealous.
Of what?
You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.
Hey, you're a doctor of gums.
That's the smallest body part you can major in.
Day one, floss.
Day two, here's your diploma.
You listen here Let me finish.
Oh, no, no.
It's about you.
What about me?
I think you may have a drinking problem.
So, you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramoray, neurosurgeon... ...recurring in at least four episodes!
The One Where They're Up All Night We've been out here for two hours... ...and we haven't seen any stupid comets.
Can we go now?
I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.
No, I'm not.
Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?
Because it's flattering!
Come on, Monica.
Come on, Monica.
We're gonna take off too.
Rented a movie.
I won't say no to a movie.
Oh, Pheebs, we just actually wanted to be alone.
Get me out of here.
Oh, okay.
Hey, Ross.
What?
Check this out.
Is it the comet?
No.
Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here.
I can't believe...
I bring you here to see the BapsteinKing comet... ...one of nature's most spectacular phenomena... ...and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and some woman.
You know, there's two women, dude.
Show me where.
Okay.
Right up here.
Joey, where's the pipe that was holding the door open?
I don't know.
Yeah, I do.
Joey!
What?
Hey, don't look at me!
You wanted to come up here and look for some stupid Burger King comet.
It's called the BapsteinKing comet, okay?
Hey, Bapstein was a very wellrespected astronomer from... No!
All right, well, I guess we know what we have to do to get down.
Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice.
Help us!
Please help us!
We're stuck up on the roof, and we can't get down!
I was thinking we'd just go down the fire escape.
I know.
I wasn't finished.
Okay, you have a good grip?
Yeah.
I'm gonna start to climb down you now.
All right, just hurry up.
Okay.
Now, should I climb down your front so we're face to face... ...or should I climb down your back so we're... ...butt to face?
Face to face.
I like face to face.
Okay, here I come.
All right.
Oh, my... How much do you weigh, Ross?
I prefer not to answer.
I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
When we talked about face to face...
...I don't think we thought it all the way through.
What do you want me to do?
Just shimmy down me and drop.
Hi.
Hi.
You know, maybe I should hang, and you should climb down me.
Yeah?
Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
It still looks pretty far.
It's not that far.
Just drop.
Do not rush me!
My pants are starting to come down, and I'm not wearing any underwear.
My ankle!
I really hurt my ankle!
I think I twisted it when... A quarter!
That really was some of your best work.

I'm so glad someone's here.
Could you zip me up?
Sure.
Thank you.
Can you believe no one between my apartment and here..   offered to do that for me?
People.
So why are you so dressed up?
Mike's picking me up for a date.
How's that going?
Is it getting serious?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I mean, I like him.
But am I ready to take my Grade A loins off the meat market?
I'm not quite sure.
You know, I really admire your whole dating attitude.
It's so healthy.
I'm always like, "Is this moving too fast?
Is this moving too slow?
Where's this going?"
I know.
You are a bit of a drama queen.
You're so much better off.
You just go from guy to guy having fun..   and not worrying that it never turns into anything serious.
I wouldn't say "never."
You know, there is that guy.
Okay, well, what about..?
Okay, there's gotta be someone.
There isn't!
That's what I'm saying.
Oh, my God, you're right!
I know.
And yet, here you are, all ready for the next date.
I can't believe I never realized this before.
I'm in my 30s, and I've never been in a longterm relationship.
Oh, my God, what's wrong with me?
There's nothing wrong with you.
I mean, you don't strike me as the type of person that wants to get married.
I want to get married!
No, please..
Please don't cry because of me.
I don't know what I'm talking about, okay?
I've been divorced three times.
At least you've been married.
Oh, my God!
I want to trade lives with Ross?!
Phoebe.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I'm excited about our date.
Mike, this is Ross Geller.
Ross, this is Mike..
Sorry, I didn't catch that.
Mike Hanigan.
Ross Geller.
Hey.
So are you sure you're ready to go?
How do I look?
Do you have a compact in your purse?
No.
You look great.
Rachel?
I thought she just had a baby with Ross.
Yeah, well..   Yeah.
But Emma's birth certificate might say "Geller"..   but her eyes say "Mukherjee."
That is so wrong.
And on top of that, he's a glue sniffer?
I know.
But he calls, and my heart goes to him.
You know, that bastard is one smoothtalking freelance kite designer.
If you want, I'll mess him up for you.
You would do that?
I think there's somebody better out there for you.
I mean, you know, I'm..
I'm not saying me, but..   Maybe.. me.
And you don't have to worry about gluesniffing with me.
Although, I do smell the occasional Magic Marker.
Yeah.
Anyway, I just..
I think I can make you happy.
Okay, I can't do this.
What's wrong?
Well, there is no Vikram.
Ross made him up.
Because I..
I really never have been in a longterm relationship.
I've never lived with a guy.
I've never even celebrated an anniversary.
So..
If that's too weird for you..   and you want to leave, I understand.
In fact, I'll close my eyes to make it less awkward.
You kissed me.
You don't think I'm a total freak?
No.
Well..   Look, can I..?
Can I think you're a little weird and also cool..   for telling me the truth and also want to kiss you?
I guess so.
Can I think it's cool that you kissed me..   and also want to kiss you again?
And be a little concerned about the Magic Markers?
Hi, honey, I'm home.
Hi.
I can't believe you haven't seen Cujo.
Relax, it isn't Citizen Kane.
Have you ever sat throughCitizen Kane?
Yeah, it's really boring.But it's, like, a big deal.
Anyway, I was thinkingabout renting Cujo.
Well, let's do it tonight.
Don't you have that big date?Oh, right.
Hey, Joey, can I ask you something?Yeah.
After our date, did you feel weird?
Oh, my God.
You did too?It freaked me out.
What was that?
I don't know.
I'm kind of thinkingit was the lobster.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, the lobster.
I was up sick all night.Me too.
All night.
Really?
We didn't cross paths.
Yeah, well, that's because..
I stayed in my room.
You don't want to lookin my hamper.
Are you all right?You seem a little distracted.
No, no, I'm fine.
It's just..   Hey, can I ask you something?
Have you ever looked at someoneyou know..   and suddenly seen themin a different way?
You can get your picture back up on the wall of fame.
He's got all the big actors.
It was so cool when I was up there.
Me and Jim Belushi would just be cracking up about something.
I get fired off Days of Our Lives and he takes me down.
Now he's just laughing at me.
Look at him.
That smug Belushi bastard!
Okay.
Maybe when they put your picture back up... they could put you by Matt Lauer.
Look at him just smiling at me.
Yeah, I know.
We'd be great together.
So I'm back.
Who are you?
Joey Tribbiani.
From the wall?
Okay, maybe this will jog your memory.
Okay, anyway.
I'm ready to go back up on the wall.
I'm the star of a new TV show.
Show me in the TV book.
It's not on TV yet.
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
Okay, fine.
I will bring you a tape.
So, now, do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes?
Maybe?
Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?
God.
I love museums.
Did you watch the tape of my show?
I did.
Let's get me back up there.
You don't go up on the wall.
What?
But you saw the show.
It was very offensive to my people.
Dry cleaners?
Russians.
It showed them as terrorists and villains.
Okay, okay.
Look, you got Harrison Ford up there!
That's right.
Mr. Ford is a very good customer.
He brings us a lot of clothes.
You bring nothing!
Okay, that may be true.
But in Air Force One, okay, the Russians were terrorists and evil!
And plus, he kills a bunch of them.
That's offensive to Russians.
I've never seen it.
You should.
It's great!
Can I help you?
Yeah, where's the guy who decides whose pictures go up on the wall?
He's not here right now.
You're kidding me!
Make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all these clothes.
I'm an actor.
I'm trying to get my picture on the wall.
You know, there are two people who could get your picture up there.
Oh, really?
Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks.
You're the other one, right?
Joey, why did you sign it "son of a bitch"?
I didn't do that.
Who would do that?
Son of a bitch!
Okay.
Maybe ask this guy.
You!
Get out of my shop!
What did he do?
He went out with my wife!
Joey!
I did not go out with your wife!
Okay?
I went out with her.
That's my wife!
Well, we should go.
Yeah.
Let me just see if I've got this right.
So this is a halfcaf, doubletall, easy hazelnut... ...nonfat, no foam, with whip, extrahot latte, right?
Okay.
Great.
You freak.
Thank you.
A coffee to go, please.
Isabella Rossellini!
Are you serious?
Oh, my God!
Damn!
I cannot believe I took her off my list.
Why?
Because otherwise you'd go for it?
Yeah, maybe.
You lie.
You don't think I'd go up to her?
It took you 10 years to finally admit you liked me.
Yeah?
Well, missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
You know what, honey?
You go ahead.
We'll call her an alternate.
Okay.
Hold my cruller.
Okay.
Are you really gonna let him do this?
He's about to go hit on Isabella Rossellini.
I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.
I'm Ross.
You don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours.
I mean... ...Blue Velvet.
I was wondering if I could maybe buy you a cup of coffee.
Or reimburse you for that one.
Aren't you with that girl over there?
Well, yeah, kind of.
But that's okay.
We have an understanding.
We each have this list of five famous people, and you were one of mine.
So I'm allowed to sleep with you.
No, no, no.
It's flattering.
I don't know...
Wait.
Wait, Isabella.
Don't dismiss this so fast.
This is a onceinalifetime opportunity.
Yeah, for you.
Is that the list?
Yes.
Can I see it?
No.
Come on.
But...
Okay.
I'm not on the list!
But that's not the final draft.
It's laminated.
Okay, see, you were on my list.
But then my friend Chandler... ...brought up the very good point that you are international.
So I bumped you for Winona Ryder.
Local.
You know, it's ironic because I have a list... ...of five goofy coffeehouse guys.
And yesterday, I just bumped you for that guy over there.
We're just gonna be friends.
You know what?
Bet you I could fit in there.
I got 5 bucks says you can't.
Get out your checkbook, mister.
I think I have the cash.
You are dog, man!
I totally fit!
Yeah.
You got me.
I'm out 5 big ones.
There you go.
Thank you.
Well, hello, Mr. Lincoln!
Better luck next time, buddy!
And the drinks are on me
I brought you something.
Is it loaded?
Oh, little candy hearts!
"Chan and Jan forever! "
I had them made special.
Okay, Janice.
Janice.
Hey, Janice.
There's no way for me to tell you this.
At least, no new way for me to tell you this.
I just don't think things are gonna work out.
That's fine.
It is?
Because I know that this isn't the end.
Oh, no.
You see, actually, it is.
No, it isn't.
Because you won't let that happen.
Don't you know it yet?
You love me, Chandler Bing!
Oh, no, I don't.
Then why do you think we keep ending up together?
New Year's, who invited who?
Valentine's, who asked who into whose bed?
I did, but.
You seek me out!
Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn!
Janice!
Janice!
You want me!
You need me!
You can't live without me!
And you know it!
You just don't know you know it.
See you.
Call me!
Well, you know the whole gettingonwithyourlife thing?
Last night we let the dice decide.
We should leave it up to fate again.
I love you!
We don't get married unless there's a sign.
So say... you roll another eight, then there's a sign... that we should marry.
Eight we get married... but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, we don't get married.
Sounds great.
Hey, we got a shooter.
Money, please.
Ready?
Ready.
Come on, eight.
Yes, yes, eight.
Eight, easy eight.
I can't believe I rolled an eight.
That was so unlikely.
Let's get married.
I guess.
Last night I rolled a hard eight.
It was the wrong kind of eight.
No wedding!
Damn it!
I wanted it so bad!
Wanna go pack?
We're doing the right thing.
Of course we are.
We left it up to fate.
If we were supposed to get married, there would be a sign.
Okay, you have 19 questions left.
That kid kicked me really hard.
Well, you did pull his hair.
He took my snack.
I'm not getting into this again.
All right, you know what?
Hurts really bad.
Well, I told you not to walk.
Here.
There.
There.
Okay.
This doesn't mean anything, does it?
No.
You look like you're.. Don't say it!
Don't even think it.
All right.
Chandler, enjoy your handful.
Should we just get married?
All the signs are telling us to do it.
I'm sick of the signs.
I'm happy the way things are.
Me too.
I don't want change, do you?
No.
Then nothing changes!
Everything stays the same!
Go unpack.
It's been three days, and it drives me insane!
Jeez, relax, it's not like we're mar.. You know, I was thinking, what if I... unpack here?
All your stuff would be here.
Well... ...what if all my stuff was here?
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time.
Doesn't make any sense.
Okay.
What if we live together, and you get what I'm saying?
Live together?
There've been no signs for that.
Me asking is kind of a sign.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Okay.
Okay, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Here's your key.
Here's your key.
Now go out and christen it!
Go out and come back in!
Door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay.
Ready?
Ready!
The key broke in the lock, and I can't get in.
Wait.
Oh, my God, I can't get out!
This isn't a sign!
No, it's a very old key!
It's an old key!
Oh, my God, it's old!
I love you.
Are you hugging the door right now?
No.
Yeah, yeah, me neither.
So did everything go all right with the annulment?
What are you doing?
Key is stuck in the lock.
I can fix it.
Hold on.
Watch out, watch out.
It still doesn't work.
I'm not finished.
Nice job, Joe.
You're quite the craftsman
I'm just thinking about something funny I heard today.
Mark saying, "I'll see you Saturday."
Yeah, at the lecture.
I told you last week.
You said you didn't mind.
It's not the lecture I mind.
Please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark.
Well...  Oh, my God!
I'm sorry, but if you're not working with him anymore... ...why do you still hang out?
Because he's my friend.
But do you really need another "friend"?
If I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
Is that funny?
Am I suppose to be laughing?
I don't know.
You thought "See you Saturday" was funny.
Mark is in fashion.
I like having a friend I can share this stuff with.
You guys would never go to a lecture with me.
I'd love to go with you.
Really?
I have clothes.
I even pick them out.
For all you know, I could be a fashion... ...monger.
I would love for you to go with me.
What?
What should I wear?
Now I'm all nervous.
We're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colors.
For instance, a sheer navy blouse over a pink...
I'm really glad we came.
You're so pretty.
Oversized bracelets, oversized earrings... ...oversizing of accessories, in general, is very popular now.
Can I borrow this?
My milk's gone bad.
So I nodded off a little!
"Nodded off"?
Ross, you were snoring!
My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
Come on!
Fortyfive minutes... Fortyfive minutes, the man talked about strappybacked dresses.
Okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium... ...listening to Professor "Pitstains" say: "Remember that thing that died a gazillion years ago?
Okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium... ...listening to Professor "Pitstains" say: "Remember that thing that died a gazillion years ago?
Well, here's a little bone we didn't know it had!"
First of all, it's Professor Pitain.
And second of all, that little bone proved that... ...that particular dinosaur had wings but didn't fly.
Okay, you know what I just heard?
A hundred million people went to see a movie about what I do.
I wonder how many people would go see a movie called Jurassic Parka.
Oh, that is so... A bunch of outofcontrol jackets take over an island!
If what I do is so lame... ...then why did you insist on coming with me this morning?
Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?
I wanted to be with you.
I don't know, I feel like lately... ...you're slipping away from me... ...with this new job and all these new people.
And you've got this whole other life going on.
I know it's dumb... ...but I just hate that I'm not a part of it.
It's not dumb.
But maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it.
You know what I mean?
I mean, it's like...
...I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
That's a little clearer.
See, it doesn't mean I don't love you... ...because I do.
I love you so much.
But my work...
It's for me, you know?
I'm out there on my own, and I'm doing it.
And it's scary, but I love it because it's mine.
But I mean, is that okay?
Sure.
Look at us all dressed up for the party.
What are we celebrating?
We had a lot of liquor left over from Christmas.
Our friends aren't here.
We can be a real couple.
We don't have to hide.
I know.
I can do this.
And I can do this.
We can't do that.
Hey, Bing!
Who's the pretty lady, and what is she doing with you?
I asked myself that very question, sir.
My boss, Doug.
This is Monica.
Hi.
This is my wife, Kara.
Nice to meet you.
Did you hear about the new law firm working for us?
Dickem, Stickem & Run.
Let's go drink our body weight.
What was that?
That noise you made?
Oh, my work laugh.
Your work laugh?
If you're going to survive this party, come up with one too.
All right.
Check me out.
He says, "$30, Father.
Same as in town."
Everybody at work loved you last night.
And they like me more just because I was with you.
You repaired the damage from when they met Joey.
Doug wants to play tennis.
He never talks to me outside of work.
Except for that time at that strip club.
Strip church.
I'll go find a racket.
We'll make this the last game.
Yes, sir.
Put me out of my misery.
Are you sure you never played pro?
Please let them win.
I'll take it down to 95%, but that's the best I can do.
Missed it!
I got it!
Nice shot.
I got it!
Long!
I can't believe you let them win.
Well, at least you hid your feelings well about it.
I was frustrated.
It's my racket.
Frustrated with you!
If we hadn't lost, they would never have invited us to dinner tomorrow.
What bothers me... ...is how different you act around them.
The throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh... ...the "See you later, Bing!"
"Not if I see you first, Doug!"
I don't like work Chandler.
The guy's a suckup.
Because you said that...
...I'm not putting out tonight!
Something's wrong.
Tough call.
Seriously, I strongly believe that we should support President Clinton... ...and her husband, Bill.
How do you like your coffee?
None for me.
A little sugar.
I'll have Monica stick her finger in it.
That will sweeten it up.
That laugh doesn't give you a headache?
You get used to it.
I don't think that I can.
This will be it for me on the work things.
I laugh at my boss's jokes.
What's the big deal?
I'd rather not be with this workweasel guy... ...when I can be with my boyfriend, who I actually respect.
I got to apologize for Kara's coffee.
I'd feel sorry for it in a fight.
It's not strong enough to defend itself.
Hear what I said?
What?
It's a joke.
What's the matter with you?
Well, I just didn't think it was funny, sir.
Excuse me?
Well, I just Honey?
I just don't think you understood the joke.
Really?
I mean, it was really funny.
I just don't think that you got it.
You see, Kara's coffee is weaktasting.
I also want you to remember that I let you live here rentfree.
All right.
And I want you to remember that I gave you... ...twentyseven dollars.

Happy Thanksgiving.
No, no, no.
What are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
We're playing a game I learned.
You have to name all the states in six minutes.
What?
That's like insanely easy.
It's harder than it sounds.
You always forget one.
Or, in some cases, 14.
It's stupid and I wasn't playing against people, so technically, I didn't lose.
You forgot 14 states?
Nobody cares about the Dakotas!
Okay, time's up.
All right, I got 48.
That's not bad.
Pheebs?
I got tired of naming states, so I decided to list the types of celery.
And I have one, regular celery.
So Rachel's got 48, and Phoebe has the lead in... ...vegetables.
Joey?
Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
Wow, how many you got?
Fiftysix.
The One Where Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs Hey, how is New England not a state?
They have a sports team.
Does South Oregon have a sports team?
There you go.
I already have that.
Done... ...with time to spare.
This may be a new world's record.
I hate to lecture you guys... ...but it's disgraceful that a group of welleducated adults... ...and Joey, can't name all the states.
You ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called a "globe"?
Magellan?
You got 46 states.
What?
That's impossible.
Fortysix.
Well, who's welleducated now, Mr. LForgotTenStates?
I'm going to go turn on Joey's oven.
Okay, time is up.
Now, just give me another minute.
If you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay?
That is the beauty of this game.
It makes you want to kill yourself.
This is crazy.
I can do this.
All right, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
Okay, but if you can't, no dinner.
You're on.
Don't look at my list, because there's a lot on there that you don't have.
How can I not get this?
I'm a college professor.
I got 1450 on my SATs.
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
And that doesn't scare you?
Ross, you need some help?
From you?
Yes, please.
First of all, Utah?
Dude, you can't just make stuff up.
Okay, Klunkers, come here, you big gerbil.
Klunkers.
Where's my Klunkers, my little...?
I hate America!
When I finish this game, I swear, I am moving.
Okay, maybe this is so hard because there aren't 50 states.
Let me tell you something.
I have 49 states... ...and there are no more!
I think I should be able to eat something.
It's up to you.
Oh, hi.
How are you doing?
I'm okay.
All right.
I want my turkey now.
You got it.
You got Nevada twice.
I know.
Yeah
Say goodbye to your tickets.
No!
No!
No!
Do not come any closer!
Can I come a little bit closer?
Valuable things are getting squished.
Now, what's more important, your friends or money?
Friends!
Money!
Friends.
Hey, Monica, what about your extra tickets?
They're all in there.
Even these five that I hid in my bra.
Monica!
Okay.
Good.
You guys were so scared.
There is no way I was gonna dump this..   God!
No!
I think I broke your bowl.
Go!
Hello.
This is the pigeon from the balcony calling to apologize.
I shouldn't have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady's hand.
It was all my fault.
Not hers.
Bye.
Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.
She said, "Gleba"!
Make me rich!
Isn't that amazing?
Oh, yeah.
No, no, no, that's great.
Why aren't you more excited?
Rach, gleba is not a word.
Well, of course it is.
Okay.
What does it mean?
Well, I don't know all the words.
You know, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first word.
Yes you did!
Gleba is a word!
Okay.
Use it in a sentence.
Okay.
Emma just said, "Gleba."
It's not a word.
Okay, fine.
I'm gonna look it up.
Okay, great.
While you're at it, she said another word the other day.
Why don't you look up:   All right.
Okay.
Okay.
Gleba.
Gleba.
Gleba.
Gleba!
Here it is!
"The fleshy, sporebearing inner mass of a certain fungi."
She's gonna be a scientist.
Farts, boobies, butt cracks!
Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program.
We're offering you the position of junior copywriter.
Me?
That guy who just said, "butt cracks"?
Yes, that's right.
We're excited about the level of sophistication..   you'll be bringing to the job.
Okay.
Well, thanks, you won't regret it.
I'll see you tomorrow.
What?
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.
Congratulations!
Oh, sweetie, I'm so proud of you.
Thanks.
Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
You bet.
No TV or anything.
Hey, that is so great about the job.
Thanks, man.
I'd like to think I had something to do with it.
Really?
Why?
Well, before with the wishbone.
I didn't wish we would win the lottery.
I wished you'd get the job.
Oh, yeah?
Listen, don't tell Monica.
She'll rip your heart right out.
Hey, guys.
So I just called the Powerball hot line.
Can you believe it?
Nobody won.
I beg to differ.
Maybe nobody won the jackpot, but there was this guy in here earlier..   and he found a ticket on the street right outside and won $10,000.
Again, don't blame the pretty lady.
It was not her fault.
It was me, the pigeon.
Seriously, stop staring at her
Can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go?
Diapers, huh?
Yep.
So I guess Rachel had your baby?
Yep.
Can you believe it?
Nope.
I can't even believe she slept with you in the first place.
You mean, like..   Hey.
I know you're pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.
Actually, we don't.
Fine.
Okay.
But I gotta say, technically, I didn't even do anything wrong.
I'm gonna go.
No, come on.
Ross, we have to get past this.
Give me the bag.
No, I don't know what else to do.
I said I'm sorry, now..   Now you should scream at me or curse me or hit me.
I'm not gonna hit you.
You'll feel better.
I'll feel better.
You know you want to, I can see it in your eyes.
I don't.
A little bit.
No.
Little bit.
No.
A little bit more.
Give me the bag.
Give me the bag.
No, hit me.
Hit me.
Give me the bag.
I'm not kidding.
Hit me.
No.
Hit me.
Hit me.
Hit me!
You ducked!
I'm sorry!
It was a reflex!
Oh, my God!
This really hurts!
I couldn't help it.
When a fist comes at your face, you duck.
Look.
What is the matter with you?
Let's talk on the way to the hospital.
Good.
Yeah, maybe while we're there, they can check your reflexes.
Try feeding her again.
You want me to help you with that?
Why, does it look like I'm having trouble with my misshapen claw?
Name?
No, I know Ross.
But what's it short for?
You know, like Rossell.
Or Rosstrophor.
Just Ross.
It's pretty.
Okay, date of birth?
You know my birthday.
Sure.
May.. tember?
October 18.
Occupation?
Dinosaurs.
Actually, I'm a paleon.. Dinosaurs is fine.
The drawing is not.
All right, who do you want as your emergency contact?
Rachel, I guess.
Okay.
Relationship?
Boy, this could take a while.
Just put roommate.
Come on.
You guys are more than that.
You're gonna get together, right?
I don't think that we are.
But you two are supposed to be together.
Well, I thought so too.
But then she said she'd marry you.
Come on, Ross, that didn't mean anything.
She'd just had the baby.
She was freaked out about doing it alone.
She would have said yes to anybody.
Yeah, that's what she said.
So?
So I don't want to be just anybody.
Wow.
You know what?
It's better this way anyway.
I don't know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us.
It's just much easier if we're just friends who have a kid.
Really?
Yeah.
And you're okay with that?
Yes.
That's what we always planned.
And if you have a plan, you should stick to it.
That's why they call them plans.
Hello?
I'm fine.
Hey, for what it's worth..   with Rachel, I don't think you'll ever be just "anybody."
Hey, there you go.
I've been thinking about this.
And I gotta tell you, it's not my fault.
It's a natural instinct.
What are you talking about?
Okay, what would you do if I did this
So how is this for our big double date tonight?
Oh, my God.
Great.
Just the reaction I was hoping for.
Yeah, so you found someone for me?
You didn't forget?
Of course not.
And you'll love Mary Ellen.
She's really smart and cute and funny and..
I can't tell you how I know this, but she is not opposed to threesomes.
All right.
So tell me something about my guy.
No.
Come on, give me something.
What's his name?
I'm not sure I understand the question.
What do they call him?
Mike.
Mike.
Okay, what's his last name?
Damn it!
Is there no mystery left in romance anymore?!
We'll see you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.
All right, great.
See you.
Byebye.
Why'd I have to say Mike?
I don't know a Mike!
Why couldn't I have said..?
There's no guys in there!
Do you not know each other?
Of course we do.
He's playing a game we used to play in high school.
We pretend we don't know each other.
We played all kinds of games.
You remember that one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?
Let me ask you something: How many sisters does Joey have?
Six.
No, he doesn't.
He has seven.
What are you doing?
I said seven!
Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?
Because I forgot about our date.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry too.
And just to be clear, I didn't hit his mother with a car.
Yeah, no problem.
You are unbelievable.
I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you.
Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.
Who are you kidding?
You find some guy off the street for me?
God, this is humiliating!
I'm so sorry.
If you don't like this guy, I can find you a better one.
Mike?
Mike?
I'm out of here.
It was nice meeting you.
You're leaving too?
I'll stay if you can tell me my name.
Have a good night.
We leave tomorrow, and you still have a lot to pack.
Hi.
I was hoping to run into you.
Can we talk?
Sure.
Look, I'm sorry, really.
I'm so embarrassed.
Please.
Really, I'm a pretty nice guy.
Just ask my parole officer.
Apparently, I'm not a funny guy.
Well, why did you go along with that?
Because I was told that I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't.
And that I'd meet a pretty girl, which I did.
That's true.
Well, is anything you told me about yourself true?
My name is Mike.
And I do play piano.
Prove it.
There isn't a piano here.
That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.
Okay.
You are really good.
I play a little guitar myself.
Really?
That's great.
What kind of music do you play?
Like acoustic, folksy stuff, you know?
But right now I'm working on a couple lron Maiden covers.
Do you think that, maybe, sometime, I could..
It's okay.
Go ahead, ask me out.
Okay.
You think, maybe, sometime I could take you out?
You just caught me off guard.
Yeah, that would be nice.
Look at this!
My two best friends!
You were very generous with your grades this semester.
Professor Geller?
Yeah?
I really enjoyed your class.
Oh, thank you.
Thanks very much.
I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie.
That was you?
Yeah.
I felt a little weird about it.
You're a teacher.
I'm a student.
Want to go out sometime?
That's not the best idea.
Oh, because I was thinking, the semester's over.
You're not my teacher anymore.
What time?
Oh, you know what?
Forget it.
I see you already gave me an A. Gotcha.
I'm kidding!
God!
Yeah, he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie.
Can you believe that?
You know, I haven't spoken to him in 10 years... and he asks me for a favor?
I don't... Oh, please, it was such a big class.
You never even noticed me.
What?
Of course I did.
You sat next to "Sleepy Sleeperson."
Who?
Oh.
I had trouble remembering names, so I came up with nicknames.
The guy on the other side of you was "Smelly Von Brown Shirt."
Oh, yeah.
So did you have a nickname for me?
Listen, I gotta tell you, I'm having a great time.
You said it might be weird, the whole student/teacher thing?
And to be frank, I thought it would be too.
But it's not.
I mean, it's not at all.
Dr. Geller!
Burt!
Did you sleep well last night?
I did.
Monica was so sweet.
What do you want to do now?
Want to get a drink?
I can't.
Oh, you have some studying to do?
No, I have some turning 21 to do.
You know, I remember when I was in college, we used to.. What are you doing?
Nothing, I'm so comfortable with you.
Do you not want to be seen with me?
No, of course I do.
Are they gone?
No, they're still here.
But I think I'm about to leave.
What?
No, no, wait, wait.. You're right, this is stupid.
Who cares what people think?
I mean, we like each other, right?
There's nothing wrong with that.
Come on.
Burt.
Lydia.
Mel.
This is Elizabeth.
Hi.
Aren't you in my popular culture class?
That's right, Lydia.
Elizabeth is a student.
And we're dating.
And you may frown upon that but... we're not gonna hide it anymore.
You are so fired.
What?
They'll fire you.
You can't date her.
It's against the rules.
Really?
It's not just frowned upon?
Wow, it actually is in the handbook.
I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office.
I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
For what it's worth, I did appreciate you standing up for me.
That felt really nice.
Kind of made me like you even more.
I know, I know.
I really like you too.
But we can't date.
It's against the rules.
It's forbidden.
Wow.
What?
Just hearing you describe it as "forbidden"... it's really hot.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, I don't care how hot it is, it's wrong.
Stop it.
No, no.
It's wrong.
It's naughty.
It's... taboo.
Shut the book.
Hey.
Let's also get a hot plate.
Honey...
...I was wondering... Do you still have that Navy uniform?
No, I had to return it to the costume place.
I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
You remember not having sex in high school, right?
Well, honey, what about you?
What?
Do you have any fun, you know, fantasytype things?
No.
Come on.
You gotta have one.
Nope.
Ross.
You know what?
What?
If you tell me, I might do it.
Did you ever see Return of the Jedi?
Do you remember the scene... ...with Jabba the Hutt?
He was this really fat worm guy.
See, Jabba had as his prisoner... ...Princess Leia.
Princess Leia was wearing... ...this gold bikini thing.
It was pretty cool.
So are you saying that you would like me... ...to dress up like Princess Leia... ...in a gold bikini?
Princess Leia and the gold bikini?
Every guy our age loved that.
Really?
It's huge!
That's the moment when she stopped being a princess... ...and she became, like, you know, a woman.
Did you ever do the Leia thing?
Oh, yeah.
Really?
That great, huh?
No, it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate.
See you.
Hey.
Hi, you guys!
"Statistical Deviations in the Carbon Dating... ...of Fossilized Algae: History or Mystery?"
Rach, look!
Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me?
You know when you're in bed with a woman... ...and fooling around... ...and you get all these mental images in your brain?
Like Elle MacPherson or the girl at the Xerox place?
With the bellybutton ring?
I know.
And then all of a sudden, your mom pops into your head.
And you're like, "Mom, get out of here!"
But after that, you can't think of anything else.
And you can't stop what you're doing.
So it's kind of like you're... ...you know... You don't know!
Your mom?
You're telling me about your mom?
What is the matter with you?
You said...
I said "share," not "scare"!
Go sit over there!
I am Jabba's prisoner.
And you... ...have a really weird look on your face.
What?
Honey, what is it?
Did I get the hair wrong?
Did you just picture it differently?
What?
No, no.
It's not you.
It's... What is it?
Come on, sweetie.
You're, like, freaking me out here.
I hate Chandler.
The bastard ruined my life
I'm not asking for a lot here.
Just give me something.
Anything.
Okay.
Okay.
When I was 6 years old, I wanted a Big Wheel.
And instead, my parents got me this little... plastic chicken that you hop around on.
It was embarrassing.
Kids made fun of me.
That was a tough year.
That's great!
See?
I already feel like I know you a little better.
Okay, come on.
Now we can go eat.
Let's go!
It was horrible.
They called me "Chicken Boy."
In fifth grade, I got in a fight.
Well, not really.
Richard Danville bit me.
I still have a little scar right here.
You can see it.
Yeah, yeah.
I see the scar.
I think this is really great that, you know, you've shared your feelings.
It's really...
It's beautiful.
But what do you say we go share some food?
No, I couldn't eat now.
What are you talking about?
You love their Kung Pao chicken!
Chicken?
Chicken Boy!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Still crying?
Like a little girl.
I know, I know.
This is all my fault.
I wanted him to open up.
I didn't know that I was gonna unleash... this weepy, clingy, moist monster!
I only know of two ways to shut a man up.
One of them is sex.
What's the other?
Don't know.
Never had to use it.
I'm just saying, if we're having sex, he's not talking.
That's right.
You're the talker.
Anyway, great idea.
I gotta buy him some more tissues.
We have some here.
Hi, I'm back.
I've written down more to tell you!
Oh, that's great.
No, actually, that's... That's great.
That's really great.
You know, I gotta tell you, writing, all that writing, it gets me...
It gets me kind of hot.
Wait, wait.
Listen to this: Know what I wanted to be at that age?
A lover?
A surfer.
A surfer?
I wanted to be one with the waves..
Hold on.
Let me just get a little more comfortable here.
Wait a second.
This isn't too revealing, is it?
No.
Whatever happened to that little dude?
So full of dreams.
I don't care about the little dude!
I can't!
I cannot listen to any more of this!
That's only because they get $100 an hour!
Do you know how much money I could have made listening to you?
$2000!
Know when I figured that out?
While you were talking!
I can't believe you're trying to stifle me when 14 hours ago... we figured out that's what my mother was trying to do!
I'm sorry.
I don't mean...
I didn't mean to stifle you.
This is all just a little overwhelming.
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to overwhelm you.
It's just that when those gates open... it's hard to close them.
But they are closed now.
Believe me.
I'm so glad.
I'm so glad you shared.
And I'm glad that you're done.
So what do you say we...
I'd like that.
That was so good!
But ask for a musket.
Ask for a musket!
We used to work together.
We did?
At Macy's.
You're the Obsession girl, right?
I was the Aramis guy.
Aramis?
Aramis?
Yeah, right!
You're the best in the business.
Get out!
I'm serious!
You're amazing!
You know when to spritz.
You know when to lay back.
Really?
You don't know what that means to me.
You smell great tonight.
What are you wearing?
Nothing.
Listen, do you wanna go get a drink?
Yeah, that would be.
What's wrong?
I remembered I have to do something.
What?
Leave.
Wait, wait, wait!
I guess you all saw it.
Saw what?
We're just laughing.
You know how laughter can be infectious.
Set another place for Thanksgiving.
My entire family thinks I have VD.
"Tonight, on a very special Blossom. "
Looking good!
I'm going to look into your eyes now.
Really?
That's my job.
All right.
Look up.
Look down.
Now, open your eyes and look down.
That's right.
Look into the light.
Now look at me.
Your eyes look good.
Those are good eyes.
Good.
They feel good.
In my head.
It was great to see you.
That's okay.
Karl!
Oh, God.
Wow!
Is that Michelle?
Yep.
I've not seen her since highschool graduation.
Oh, my God, that night she got so dru Emotional.
You know, she's having another baby.
I thought she just had one.
No, no.
Henry's almost 2.
And he's talking and everything.
Here.
The other day he told me he liked me better than his other grandpa.
In all fairness, his other grandpa's a drunk, but still... You're a grandpa.
Are we nuts here?
I don't know.
Maybe.
I mean, I'm dating a man whose pool I once peed in.
I didn't need to know that.
I guess 21 years is a lot.
I mean, hell, I'm a whole person who can drink older than you.
So maybe we should just... Maybe... Wow.
This really sucks.
Yeah, it sure does.
We don't really have to decide anything right now, do we?
No, there's no rush or anything.
Pizza delivery!
Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys!
Hey, who's your friend?
Hey, Joey.
Erin.
You're still here.
We ended up spending the day together and had such a great time.
Why wouldn't you?
Erin is great.
And then there's you guys.
Well, listen, I better get going.
Today was great.
Thanks.
And, Joey, last night was fun.
Yeah.
I'll call you.
I'll call you too.
Or I'll call you.
And call me.
Okay.
Look at that, we're all gonna call each other.
Good to see you again.
Byebye.
Bye.
The system kind of broke down, huh?
Joey, I'm sorry.
I just couldn't tell her all those things.
And we got to talking, and I... We want you to marry her.
What?
She is so amazing.
You have no idea.
Who do you think brought her here?
Cupid.
She's so cool.
She speaks four languages.
Man, do you know what guys want.
Come on, she's so perfect for you.
She's sweet.
She likes baseball.
She had two beers at lunch.
My beers?!
Look, she's a very nice girl.
We had a very good time, but I don't see it going anywhere.
You always say that.
Maybe if you gave her a chance, it would go somewhere.
I'm sorry, you guys.
I just don't think so.
Whatever.
Fine.
Hey, don't start judging me.
You're in love with your assistant.
You're having an affair with the guy who keeps pigeons on the roof.
Phoebe!
How's it going with Joey?
Oh, okay.
Okay?
Tell me that you like him, please.
I mean, tell me that you like him.
He's a really great guy, and I know you really want this to work out... ...but I just don't see this having a future.
But you said that you liked him.
What happened?
Did you just change your mind?
Kind of.
Then change it back!
I'm sorry.
It's just, there's no real spark.
Didn't you sleep together?
Yeah.
Tramp.
Does Joey have any idea?
I don't think he does.
You know what?
Maybe you could tell him I'm not interested... ...in a serious relationship.
You mean, like, that you're kind of a loner?
Yeah, that'd be great.
And maybe that you're a real stronzo.
I'm sorry?
I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.
Hey.
Want to go?
Yeah, let's go.
Okay.
See you guys later.
Bye, guys.
Hey, thank you so much.
Wow.
I guess it wasn't cupid that brought her here.
No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
Yes, yes?
How can I help you?
So how was your date?
Great.
We walked around the Village.
We went to this icecream place.
Split a milk shake.
Seventythirty, but still.
I'm thinking of taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
Really?
She said she wants to go?
No, it's a surprise.
It's gonna be tricky because she's busy at work.
Not for me.
No, I want to spend as much time with her as I can.
Okay, honey.
Joey, we need to talk, okay?
I got the feeling from her... ...that she's not looking for a serious relationship.
Where are you getting this?
She told me.
She said she's kind of a loner.
Joey...  Hey, Rach, it's cool, you know.
I'm a loner too, right?
Hey, Joey.
You know what?
You are way too good for her.
I promise, next time I will tell them you're not looking for a relationship.
No, don't do that.
Just... Next time, make sure she likes me.
Well, that too.
Joey?
Do you want some pancakes?
Finally.
What are we gonna do?
Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?
Yes, sir?
I need to talk to you about your midterm exam.
I'm afraid I had to fail you.
Why?
Well, you need 60% to pass.
What did I get?
Seven.
That's not so good.
No, no, it's not.
What happened, Ned?
Maybe you can cut me some slack.
I'm sort of in love.
I'm sorry, but that's really not my problem.
I'm in love with you.
That brings me in the loop a little.
That's why I did so bad on this test.
I'm having a hard time concentrating.
When you're up there and you're teaching... ...and your face gets all serious... You look so good.
When you wear that tight little turtleneck sweater...
I'm your teacher.
I'm sorry.
You're a student.
And I like women.
In spite of what may be written on the backs of these chairs.
That guy at the counter's totally checking you out.
A kid in my class said he's in love with me.
Whoa!
Whoa, what?
Ross has a boyfriend!
I do not have a boyfriend.
There's a guy in one of my classes who has a crush on me.
Really?
Yeah.
Last year, Elizabeth, now this kid... What is it?
Am I giving out some kind of... ...sexyprofessor vibe?
Not right now.
The point is, my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
Now I feel bad for the kid.
I had a crush on a teacher once, and it was so hard.
I couldn't concentrate.
I blushed every time he looked at me.
You remember what it's like to be 19 and in love.
I can cut him some slack.
Yeah.
How'd you get over that teacher?
I didn't.
I got under him.
Problem solved.
Bye, Phoebe.
Okay, bye.
All right.
How can I help you?
I know I didn't do well on my midterms and stuff.
But I was hoping you could change my grade.
And why, exactly, would I do that?
Because I'm in love with you.
What?
Yeah.
I'm all in love with you and stuff.
So could you change my grade?
No!
Why not?
You changed Ned's grade.
That's different.
Because he was actually in love with me.
No, he's not!
He's totally yanking your chain.
He's done this with three other teachers.
What?
He's got a girlfriend.
I can't believe someone would do that for a grade.
I know.
It's awful.
I love you.
Can I speak to you for a moment?
That was a great lecture today.
Did you get a little haircut?
Yeah, yeah.
Do you like it?
Do you love it?
I want you to know I'm changing your grade back.
What?
Why?
I know what you're trying to pull here.
It won't work.
I'm not trying to pull anything.
Look, I love you, dude.
I'm not even gonna talk about this.
This little "thing" is over.
I know you have a girlfriend.
And I know about the other professors.
How do you think that makes me feel?
You used me!
You don't love me and you never did!
Professor Winston.
Professor Frederickson.
I'll be right with you.
Don't make this worse and I'll give you a "C." Shall we?
That's rough.
It's not all bad.
I'm learning toappreciate the small things, like..   the sound of a birdand the color of the sky.
The sky's blue, Ross.And I had sex yesterday.
Please help me.I have a date tonight.
It has to go well.I'm scared for my health.
I got something.It's this story that I came up with.
Very romantic.Any woman that hears it is putty.
Tell it to me.
Now, you're gonna want to have sexwith me when you hear it.
Remember, it is just the story.
I'll try to control myself.
Years ago, I was backpackingacross Western Europe..   You were backpacking across Europe?Have a nice six more months.
I'm sorry.
Please, please.You were in Western Europe, and..?
I was outside Barcelona, hikingin the foothills of Mount Tibidabo.
Nice.Thanks.
I was at the end of this path,and there was a lake.
Very secluded.There were tall trees all around.
It was dead silent.Gorgeous.
And across the lake I sawa beautiful woman bathing herself.
But she was crying.
Why?
This is great wine.
It's from France.
In Europe.
Western Europe.
A few years ago I was backpackingacross Western Europe.
Really?Wait, it gets better.
Yeah, I was in Barcelona.
I studied for a year in Barcelona.
I was 13?
So anyway, I was hiking..I love hiking!
That's great!
I was hiking along the foothillsof Mount Tibidaybo..
I think it's "Tibidabo.
"Do you want to tell the story?
How'd your date go?
Great.
I'm across the streethaving sex right now.
Your story sucks.Then you didn't tell it right.
Show me how you did it.No, I don't want to.
How long since you seen a girl naked?I was backpacking..
I'm not feeling it.I was outside Barcelona, hiking..   Ross, I'm not hot.
Are you hot?It's been six months.
I'm always hot.
You're not selling the story.You don't believe it.
I gotta go, I got a date.But try this.
Do what I do before an audition.
I'm not hungry.
No.
Use my camera to record yourselfand see what you're doing wrong.
I'll try that.
Now, you're all set up.
Good to go.Just hit record.
Good luck.
If you ever have any problem with theladies, you know I'll help you out.
That means a lot to me, man.
Can I get you anything?Lens cleaner?
Your battery okay?
Ross, thank God you're here.You have to help me.
Were you talking to yourself?
That's less embarrassing.Yes.
Yes, I was.
When she came in,I totally forgot about the camera.
It kept rollingand recorded everything.
Yeah, we're gonna needto see that tape.
Keep the change.
Thanks, Lizzy.
Want a pretzel?
No, I'm fine.
Thanks.
See you.
A thumb?
I know.
I opened it and there it was floating in there, like this tiny little hitchhiker.
Maybe it's a contest?
Like "Collect all five. "
Does anyone wanna see?
No, thanks!
Don't do that.
Come on!
It's worse than the thumb.
This is so unfair.
Why is it unfair?
So I have a flaw!
Big deal!
Joey's constant knuckle cracking isn't annoying?
And Ross, overpronouncing every word.
And Monica, who snorts when she laughs.
I mean, what the hell is that thing?
I accept those flaws.
Why can't you accept me for this?
Does the knucklecracking bother everybody, or just him?
I could live without it.
Is it like, a little annoying?
Or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
Don't listen to him, Pheebs.
I think it's endearing.
Oh, you do, do you?
There's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
lndeed there isn't.
I should get back to work.
Otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
The hair comes out and the gloves come off.
Don't you respect your body?
Don't you see what you're doing?
I've had it with you and your cancer, emphysema and heart disease.
The bottom line is smoking is cool, and you know it.
Alan wants to speak to you.
Really?
He does?
Hey, buddy!
What's up?
She told you about that, huh?
Well, yeah.
I have one now and then.
Well, yeah, now.
It's not that bad.
Well, that's true.
Gee, no one's ever put it like that before.
Well, okay.
Thanks.
God, he's good.
If only he were a woman.
Oh, Lamb Chop!
Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a new career from scratch.
It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it.
Maybe now's not the right time to be starting a family.
So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?
Yeah.
Goodbye.
Okay, it's baby time.
Pants off, Bing.
Didn't see you there, Geller.
Ross is here, so..   And I was really hoping that maybe I could hang out.
You know, what do you feel like doing?
Well, we're gonna have sex.
I don't feel like having sex.
Maybe..
I don't know.
Maybe we can watch a movie or something.
Let me put it this way:   We're having sex whether you're here or not.
Pants off, Bing.
Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to.
Do you have a blue tie that would go with this?
Emma spit up on mine.
Yeah, but you have to give it back if I get a job.
Of course, by that time, ties will be obsolete..   and we'll all be wearing silver jumpsuits.
Hey, good morning, lover.
I gotta say, after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees.
Here's an idea.
You walk into a room, take a quick scan.
Sorry.
But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.
Oh, God, I have to tell you something.
You're not pregnant.
What are you talking about?
Well, that thing that I have to do to make a baby?
I faked it.
What?
You faked it?
You know what?
You faked it?
You couldn't have faked it.
Yes, you can.
You just make the faces and the noises.
Guys can fake it?
Unbelievable.
The one thing that's ours.
Why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?
Well, that's actually why.
Look, I'm starting a whole new career now.
I'm not saying I don't want a baby.
I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.
Like a month?
Or a year?
Really?
You wanna wait a year?
It could be less than a year.
I mean, you've heard my stuff.
"Pants.
Like shorts but longer."
It'll probably be more than a year.
I really wanna have a baby.
Well, yeah, me too.
Look, I'll just get my old job back.
No, I want you to have a job that you love..   not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.
I quit, and you learn what I do?
I think there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby.
Now you're unemployed, and in a little while..   you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy.
There's always gonna be a reason not to do this..   but I think once the baby comes, we'll forget about all those reasons.
I guess.
I mean, it's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
It's gonna be really scary.
I mean, God, when we have a baby..   there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control.
I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess.
I won't have time to clean it.
What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer..   and messes up all the ribbons?
What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer..   because the baby's stuff takes up all the space?
Where will all the ribbons go?
Should we go make a baby before you change your mind?
Yes, please!
Okay.
And I promise I will not fake it this time.
Well, I wish I could say the same.
I'm a little shook up.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh, my God!
Oh, well.
The One After Vegas Why are we in bed together?
I don't know.
Did we?
I don't know.
Do you have any clothes on?
Yes.
Really?
No.
But we didn't have.. ...sex, did we?
I don't remember much about last night.
It was such a blur.
I remember laughing.
I laughed a lot.
Then we didn't have sex.
Well, so, what did we do last night?
I don't think so.
Oh, thank God.
Oh, I mean, we were really drunk.
I'm glad we didn't do anything stupid.
Tell me about it.
What?
Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night?
What do you mean "last night"?
Nothing happened last night.
Ross invited us all to watch.
What is the matter with you?
We weren't gonna miss our friends getting married.
Who got married?
You did.
What?
Hello.
We didn't get married.
No, we didn't.
That's ridi..
Wait, wait, wait.
I remember being in a chapel.
They would not let us get married when we were that drunk.
They let you get married.
Most people who marry in Vegas are drunk.
Now, I'm drunk right now.
I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?
I'm on vacation.
What are you gonna do?
Well, I guess we find a divorce lawyer.
Well, I think..
I think Ross already has one.
Okay.
Now, this one's free, right?
Because you paid for the first two.
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you... ...because we don't need to get divorced.
We're just gonna get an annulment.
An annulment?
Ross, I don't think surgery is the answer here.
Oh, that's your thing!
What?
Your thing.
You're the guy who gets divorced.
No, no, that's not "my thing."
I do not love getting divorced.
Yes, you do.
This is your third divorce.
You love divorce so much, you're probably gonna marry it... ...and then it won't work out, so you're gonna have to divorce it.
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?
Rachel, come on.
Talk to me.
Please!
Talk to you?
I can't even look at you right now.
What?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Rachel said everything was okay.
What are they talking about?
Just get away from me!
I made a mistake, okay?
A mistake?
What were you trying to put it in?
Her purse?
Where did he put it?
Ross, you had sex with another woman!
Oh, my God!
I knew something had to be wrong... ...because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk... You guys knew about this and you didn't tell us?
He has sex and we get hit in our heads!
Know what?
I want you to leave!
Just get out!
Now!
I want to stay.
I want to talk about this.
Okay.
All right.
How was she?
What?
Was she good?
Don't answer that.
You said you wanted to talk about it.
How was she?
She was...
Awful.
She was not good.
Horrible.
Nothing compared to you.
She was different.
Good different?
Nobody likes change.
Just stop!
What?
Okay!
Okay!
Okay!
Should we do something?
Yeah.
Never cheat on Rachel.
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.
I was disgusted with myself... ...and this morning I was upset... ...and then I got your message and I was so happy.
And all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment... Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Wait a minute.
What time did your little friend leave?
Oh, my God.
She was there?
She was still there?
She was in there when I was in there?
Listen, the important thing is, she meant nothing to me.
And yet she was worth jeopardizing our relationship!
I didn't think there was a relationship.
I thought we were broken up.
We were on a break.
That, for all I knew, could last forever.
That, to me, is a breakup.
You gonna get out of this on a technicality?
I'm not trying to "get out" of anything, okay?
I thought our relationship was dead.
Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake.
You know what?
I don't think we should listen to this anymore.
What are you doing?
We can't go out there.
Why not?
I'm hungry.
Because they'll know we've been listening.
God!
And to have to hear about it from Gunther!
Like I wanted him to tell you?
I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
Oh, that is so sweet.
I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
I think we can go out.
They have more important things to worry about.
We'll be fine.
Look, Rachel, I wanted to tell you.
I thought I should.
I did.
And then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to!
Wax the door shut.
We're never leaving.
Hi, it's Phoebe.
Listen, someone has to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehak... ...because it's 9:15 now, and I'm not there.
No, I'm in the middle of a huge relationship fight, so... Oh, that's all right.
Don't you realize none of this would ever have happened if I didn't think... ...at that same moment you were having sex with Mark?
All right.
Let's say I had slept with Mark.
Would you have been able to forgive me?
Yes, I would.
You'd be okay if you knew... ...that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me... ...and made love to me?
Yes.
If you knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were...
Okay, okay.
Yeah, I would have been devastated... ...but I would still want to be with you.
Because, I mean, it's you.
What?
Come on, Rachel, tell me what you're thinking.
You know what?
I'm not the one that wanted that break, okay?
So, what do you think?
I've still got it.
Why did you get me this?What is it?
It's yelling, bleeding, dilating.
Oh, the dilating!
Is this the video of the birth?
It'sPhoebe's.
Why were you watching it?
I thought maybe you got me pornfor Valentine's Day.
If you thought I was gonnaget you porn for Valentine's Day..   you were right.
It's about a girl who movesto the city in search of stardom..   but ends up having sexwith a lot of guys.
It got four stars.
Wait a minute.
Those aren't stars.
Anyway, you wanna take a look?Well..
I'm not really in a sexy mood.Hey, what's going on?
Remember the first timeyou saw Jaws..   how long it tookto go back in the water?
We can't let this tapewreck Valentine's Day.
Happy Valentine's Day!
Or, something to remember me by.
How long has it been this time?Ninety seconds.
Ninety seconds is a long timenot to think about it.
Except all I did was think about it.
I know.
It haunts me.
Till now, the worst thing I'd seen wasmy dad doing shots off the houseboy.
After this, I would gladlymake that my screen saver.
We have to get past this.We'll pretend it never existed.
I could do that.
Now all we gotta dois get rid of this chair.
Oh, thank God!I know.
Come in!
Hi.
I'm sorry to barge inon your Valentine.
I had to get away from the yelling.Mona's dumping Ross.
Oh, my God.Poor Ross.
We watch him do yoga in his underwear,but for this he closes the drapes.
You know that birthing tapeyou wanted to see?
It's here.
We should warn you beforeyou watch it.
Don't watch it.
You saw it?
Is it scary?
It's ironic how footageof someone being born..   can make you want to kill yourself.
Honey, she may not have to watch itbut she's going to have to do it.
Now I'm all freaked out.Will you watch it with me?
Monica, come on.You want to have kids.
I do.
But the storkis gonna bring mine.
Seriously, you're not gonnamake me watch this alone.
She's right.
Of course not.
Honey, get the tape.
This reminds me of a very specificpart of the tape.
Oh, sure.
Why have I seen this thingthree times?
It's beautiful.
You guys!
You guys, look!What?
Did her ass explode?
No, the baby's out.
Look.
Look at those little fingers and toes.
Look how happy the mom is now.
Oh, Rach.Screw you!
You don't have to do it!
But I can't do anything about it.
I hope you don't take this the wrong way... ...but I know we had plans to meet up tonight.
I'm worried about what it might do to our friendship.
I know.
How could we have let this happen?
Seven times!
You know, look.
We were away.
In a foreign, romantic country.
I blame London.
Bad London!
So look... ...while we're still in London, we can keep doing it, right?
Well, I don't see that we have a choice.
But when we're back home, we don't do it.
Only here.
You know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs.
I'll meet you there in two minutes.
Mon?
I gotta ask you something.
Now?
Ross said my name.
I can't just pretend it didn't happen.
I don't know.
Monica, what should I do?
Just do the right thing.
What?
Tow the line!
Thread the needle!
Think outside the box!
I'll talk to Ross about what he thinks it meant.
Wait!
Rachel, no.
He's married.
Married.
If you don't realize that, I can't help you.
Okay.
You're right.
You're right.
You can't help me.
Jack, is it all our fault?
Were we bad parents?
Who serves steak when there's no place to sit?
How are you supposed to eat this?
Hey, what's up?
You and me, next dance?
We were supposed to meet.
Forget it.
That's off.
Why?
The next tour of the wine cellar... ...will commence in two minutes.
Joey, what are you doing?
You promised, no meat till Phoebe has the babies.
We're in another country, so it doesn't count.
True.
He's got a point.
I'm sorry things aren't working out.
In the middle of everything, if I scream, "Yippee!"
just ignore me.
Oh, my God!
Rachel!
Oh, hello, Rachel.
Ross said my name.
Okay?
My name!
Ross said my name up there.
That obviously means he still loves me!
Don't believe me.
I know I'm right.
Do you guys want to go and get a drink?
Yes, we do.
But we have to change first.
Yes, I want to change.
Go get a table.
We'll only be five minutes.
Fifteen minutes.
Oh, Phoebe!
It's Phoebe!
Oh, hey, hey.
Oh, great.
So, what happened?
Well, Ross said my name.
But I don't think that means anything.
Let's look at this objectively.
Ninth grade, right?
The obsession starts.
Then he sees me in a twopiece for the first time.
His obsession begins to grow, right?
Why don't we go change in my room?
My clothes are... Wow, you look No time for that.
Hey, dude!
Let me in!
I got a girl out here!
I got a girl in here!
No, you don't.
I saw you go in with Monica.
Well, we're hanging out.
Which one of us will be having sex in there?
Me or you?
I suppose I would have to say you.
What if we're watching a movie?
Which we are!
And we've paid for it.
It's My Giant.
My Giant?
I love that movie!
Think this is okay?
Oh, God!
Is that Baywatch?
Yes, but I just watch it for the articles.
So is Joey around?
No, he's not back yet.
Come in, have a seat.
Bow or stern?
I don't have a preference.
You?
I like it in the stern.
Of the boat.
It's me.
Casey and I had a little car trouble.
What happened?
We broke down.
I have to get transmission fluid.
Tell Kathy that I'm sorry and I'll be there soon.
Why can't you tell her?
I think my time is about to I thought your time ran out.
Me too, but I guess I do have Joey's running a little late, and he says he's sorry.
I guess it's just you and me, then.
Okay.
Yeah, I think it is.
So, what'd you do today?
I had an appointment to cut my hair.
Looks great!
And then it got canceled.
I could cut it.
Really?
Do you do that?
Yeah, I learned at my aunt's doggrooming shop.
What do you say?
Dog grooming?
Don't make my tail too poofy.
You have really great hair.
Oh, thanks.
I grow it myself.
You know who also has great hair is Joey.
Yes, Joey has great hair.
I'm basically done here.
Let me get this hair off your neck.
What are you doing?
Checking to see if it's even.
Looks good.
The phone!
The phone's making sounds!
Hey, dude, it's me.
Hey, it's Joey!
It looks like we'll be stuck here.
I got the fluid.
The transmission wasn't there.
What?
It fell out.
I just figured we hit a dog.
Could you put Kathy on?
I want to apologize to her.
It's Joey.
No, it's fine.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah, no, stop apologizing.
It's okay.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I should probably go.
I forgot my purse.
I really did.
I forgot my purse.
This is bad!
It's bad!
Horrible!
Wait, the kiss or the situation?
The kiss was good.
But that's bad!
Here's what we do.
We forget it happened.
What?
We swallow our feelings, even if we're unhappy forever.
Sound good?
Can you really do that?
I have to.
He's my best friend.
And you're seeing him.
Chandler, I like Joey a lot.
But with you No, don't!
Don't, see?
You're getting me confused.
I'm starting to yearn.
I'm sorry.
If you want to pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
I think we have to.
Are you still out there?
Electrifying Infinite time There's a Starbucks about three blocks down.
When you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking... ...and one thing led to another, and... And what?
You have no respect for my privacy?
Rachel, wait!
No, you wait!
Can I just say one thing?
What?!
What?
That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your nippular area.
The One With the Boobies Honey, honey tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are other things.
Like when the phone rings and she takes a shower.
That's pretty much it.
But you tell it really well, sweetie.
Thanks.
Now go away so we can talk about you.
Okay.
I'll miss you.
Isn't he great?
He's so cute.
And he likes you so much.
I know.
I know.
He's so sweet.
And so complicated, you know?
And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky.
You know?
Think you'll do it on his couch?
I don't know.
That's a little weird.
It's vinyl.
You guys want anything else?
Could I have.
We're all out.
Anybody else?
Did I miss something?
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
What were you doing seeing her boobies?
It was an accident.
I wasn't across the street with a telescope and a box of doughnuts.
Can we change the subject, please?
Because, hello?
These aren't her "boobies. "
These are her breasts.
Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
I don't know why you're embarrassed.
They were very nice boobies.
"Nice"?
They were "nice"?
That's it?
I mean, mittens are "nice. "
Rock, hard place me.
You're so funny!
He's really funny!
I wouldn't want to be there when the laughter stops.
Back up there, sparky.
What did you mean by that?
It seems that maybe you have intimacy issues that you use your humor to keep people at a distance.
I mean, I just met you.
I don't know you from Adam.
Only child, right?
Parents divorced before you hit puberty.
How did you know?
It's textbook.
Hey, you guys.
You all know my dad, right?
How long are you in the city?
Two days.
I got a job midtown.
I'm better off staying with the kid than going back and forth on the ferry.
I don't know this one.
This is my friend Roger.
Good to meet you.
You too.
What happened to the puppet guy?
Dad!
Excuse me.
So, Ross, how's the wife?
0 for 2, huh?
Chandler, quick, say something funny!
Gotta go.
Please tell me one of them is Ma.
Of course one of them's Ma.
What's the matter with you?
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life.
He's like actually some spy working for the CIA.
That'd be cool!
This blows!
I know.
Why can't parents just stay parents?
Why do they have to become people?
Why do they have.
Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
What?
Didn't you get a good enough look the other day?
We're all adults here.
There's only one way to resolve this.
Since you saw her boobies you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
You know, I don't see that happening.
Come on.
He's right.
Tit for tat.
Well I'm not showing you my tat!
I just called Joshua.
How'd it go?
I did my best to convince him that I'm not... ...some crazy girl who's dying to get married.
And I'm going through a hard time.
What'd he say?
His answering machine was very understanding.
I feel blue.
I bet you anything he'll call you again.
Yeah, maybe.
But, you know, I don't think I even care.
I don't think he's the one I'm sad about.
I know I said I'm totally okay with Ross getting married.
But as it turns out...
...I don't think I'm handling it all that well.
Yeah, maybe.
And I'm just trying to figure out why.
Any luck?
You know how Ross and I have always been onagain, offagain?
I guess I just figured, somewhere down the road... ...we would be on again.
Again.
You know what?
I think we all did.
I got us reservations for Sunday night.
How about Ernie's at 9:00?
Well, you'd better make it for three.
I don't know if we're going to be hungry at three.
Three people.
Joshua's not going to be there.
What happened?
Well, I think he broke up with me.
No.
Why?
Apparently, he scares easy.
Rachel, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Sometimes things don't work out the way you thought they would.
Come here.
Don't you have to go pick up Emily?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I got my girls.
Hey, you know what might cheer you up?
What?
I got to tell you... ...this really does put me in a better mood.
I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time.
Maybe someday there will be.
Chandler's coming by to borrow candles for his big date.
Rachel, don't get it!
He'll see us!
The groom cannot see the bride.
I'm not going to marry Chandler.
Not after this!
Okay guys, just relax.
I do!
I got to go.
Yeah, well, that ought to do it.
It's really red.
You should go see my eye doctor.
I'm not gonna see your exboyfriend.
That's all I hear.
Richard, Richard, Richard.
Since we've dated, I've said his name twice.
Okay.
So Richard, Richard.
It's not Richard.
It's this new guy.
He's good.
I'm sorry.
I'm not going to an eye doctor.
Oh, God.
Here we go.
What?
Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's... ...she, like, freaks out.
Watch.
Ross, come on!
I have a weird thing with my eye.
Can we not talk about it?
Hey, Rach.
You know that great song?
"Me, Myself and Eye."
Monica!
Come on!
All those in favor of getting lunch, say, "eye."
Ross!
Stop it!
How much did I love The King and Eye?
Chandler!
Me too, me too!
Just stop it!
That's enough!
You okay there, man?
Yeah.
I got too excited.
Sorry, I didn't see you there.
Phoebe, are you mad at me or something?
If you are, please tell me what it is I did.
If you don't know, I can't help you.
I don't know.
Well, I can't help you.
Well, whatever it is, I am very, very sorry.
Okay?
Apology accepted.
So we're good?
I'll see you later, okay?
Bye, fatass.
All right!
Will you please tell me what it is that made you so mad at me?
I don't know!
I don't remember!
What do you mean, you can't remember?
I was so focused on being mad at you, I forgot what it was I was mad about.
If you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?
Oh, no.
I am mad at you.
I know that much.
But I'm sorry about the fatass thing because you have a sweet, little heinie.
All right, put your head back.
Now open your eyes.
Okay, they are.
How many fingers am I holding up?
Four.
I was thinking four.
Really?
Yes!
Why don't we start with a practice one.
No drops.
Great!
On three.
One, two, three.
My pillow's all wet!
Well, you said it was practice!
Why did you move?
I knew you were lying!
Come here.
What are you doing?
Stop it!
Oh, my God!
You really are freakishly strong.
Stop!
Stop!
Stop it!
Damn, it's empty!
If Joey and Chandler walked in now, we could make a fortune.
That's prison.
I know how we're gonna figure this out.
Clear your mind... ...and answer the first thing that comes into your head.
Do you like flora or fauna?
Fauna.
Simon or Garfunkel?
Garfunkel.
Why are you mad?
You said I was boring.
When did I say that?
Oh, my God!
I remember now!
We were playing chess.
Phoebe, you and I have never played chess.
Remember that time on the frozen lake?
We were playing.
You said I was boring.
Then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz.
There's a chance this may have been a dream.
Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?
Go!
What are you doing?
Get off!
Oh, my God!
Hey, I brought you some lunch.
Oh, that's so sweet of you.
Oh, yum.
Did you put pickles on this?Well, yeah.
What?
What?
Rach, what?
What's going on?I made her tuna with pickle.
Pickle?
Pickle makes her sick.
Giving her pickle is like giving me salad.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
You okay?
I'm fine, but someone make sureit's gone when I get out?
I'm on it!
I shouldn't be the one making her throw up.
lt could happen to anyone.Not to you.
You know this stuff.
I don't know any of it and I'm the father.
I wish I could be more involved, you know?
Well, if anyone is keeping score,I no longer eat tuna.
Can I talk to you guys for a second?
Yeah.What's up?
Sit down.I wanna talk about our situation.
Are you breaking up with us?
The thing is..   because I live with Rachel,I'm here for a lot of stuff.
And Ross is missing everything.
So..   Yeah?
You two should live together.
Are you asking me to move?You don't want me here?
No, I love living with you.It just seems that..   if you're gonna have a roommate,it may as well be the father.
But, Joey, I don't think Ross wants meto move in and disrupt his life.
Or he does.
I would love to be aroundfor you and the baby.
We can just try it,like on a temporary basis.
But it's you and me.lt wouldn't be anything romantic.
I'm dating Mona.
Damn it, Mona!
I was supposed to meet heran hour ago.
What is wrong with me?
So, what do you think?
I don't know.
Is it crazy?No.
Joey, this is a smart idea.
Well, I was due.
Let's do it.Really?
Rach, that's great.
That's great.
Hey.Hey.
So Rachel's all moved out?How you taking it?
I wanted to have a few beers..   but I got rid of those becauseRachel couldn't stand the smell.
I have thrown back a lotof orange juice with calcium.
It's a couple weeks past its expirationdate, so it's got a bit of a kick.
Are you okay?You kidding me?
Yeah, I'm great.
I'm better than great.
I am good.
Now that she's gone, I can do stuffaround here that I couldn't do before.
Like..
I can walk around naked again.
I can..
I can watch porn in the living room.
This is good for me.
I like being on my own.I'm better off this way.
I'm a lone wolf.
A loner.
Alone.
All alone.
Forever.
What's a wolf gotta doto get a hug around here?
And I won't be speaking with youfor several weeks
New York City has no power And the milk is getting sour But to me it is not scary 'Cause I stay away from dairy Here goes.
You'll do it?
I'll do it.
Want help?
You come out there, you're a dead man.
Good luck, man.
Thanks.
Where you going?
Looks like I was second to last.
It's so nice.
I have a question.
Actually, it's not so much a question it's more of a general wondering.
Here goes.
Well, for a while now, I've been wanting to.
Yes, that's right.
Look at that little kitty!
I'm on the top of the world Looking down on creation And the only explanation I can find Is the love that I found Ever since you've been around All right, this is just Bactine.
It won't hurt.
Sorry, that was wax.
Poor little Tootie's scared.
We should find his owner.
Why not put "poor little Tootie" in the hall?
During a blackout?
She'll get trampled.
On second thought, gum would be perfection.
Oh, no, the Mellons.
They hate all living things, right?
We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
It's mine.
He seems to hate you.
Are you sure?
It's my cat.
Give me my cat.
Wait a minute.
What's his name?
Bob.
Buttons.
Bob Buttons?
Bob Buttons.
Here, Bob Buttons.
You are a very bad man!
You owe me a cat.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Where did you go, little kitty, kitty?
Come on, lucky sixes!
Everybody, this is Paolo.
Paolo, I want you to meet my friends.
This is Monica and Joey and Ross.
He doesn't speak much English.
Monopoly!
Look at that!
Where did Paolo come from?
Italy, I think.
No, I mean tonight, in the building?
Suddenly into our lives?
The cat turned out to be Paolo's cat.
Isn't that funny?
That is funny.
And Rachel keeps touching him.
I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
I found him.
It was Paolo's cat.
Well, there you go.
Last to know again.
And I'm guessing, since nobody told me, this is Paolo?
Paolo, this is Phoebe.
You betcha!
All right.
Frank Jr. and Alice got married!
Oh, my God!
They're having a baby!
They want me to grow it for them in my uterus!
My God!
Are you serious?
You're thinking of having sex with your brother?
Ew!
And, oh, no!
They want me to be the surrogate.
It's her egg and his sperm.
I'm the oven.
It's their bun.
What did you say?
I had to think about it first, but what is there to think of?
I'll be giving someone the greatest gift.
You'll carry their child and get them a Sony PlayStation?
This is an incredible thing to do.
But there are things to think about.
Yeah, you'd be pregnant.
I mean, pregnant.
I know.
You'll put your body through an awful lot.
I mean, morning sickness, labor.
It's all for somebody else.
Yeah.
What's your point?
Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
I couldn't do that.
I always figured the first time I had a baby, it'd be with someone I love.
And that baby was, you know... ...a keeper.
You were more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
If you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
Just think it through.
Talk to somebody who's had a baby.
Like your mom.
My mom never gave birth.
Oh!
But my birth mom did!
I love this tushy!
I can't watch this.
It's like Sophie's Choice.
You know, I never saw that.
Oh, it was only okay.
I can't do this.
My mom was right.
If I can't give him up... ...there's no way I can give up a baby.
Frank and Alice are going to be so crushed.
What else can I give them?
A kidney!
We were in the neighborhood.
We want to let you know that there's still no pressure.
If there was something you wanted to say, we'll be right there.
Who's this little guy?
He's so cute!
He reminds me of my old dog, Tumor.
You are so precious, I could take you home.
Why don't you?
Are you serious?
Yeah.
Thanks.
What are you doing?
I'm okay with this.
You know why?
Because look at them.
Look how happy they are.
And I made that, so you know...
It'll be a million times harder to give up a baby, but oh, my God!
It'll feel a million times better, right?
I'll do this.
I want to carry your baby.
Thank you so much!
You don't know what this means to us.
I think I'm going to cry!
It's going to be so great.
What's going on?
I gave them the puppy.
It made them so happy, I decided to carry their baby.
Phoebe No, I know.
We're different, though.
This is a different situation.
I am not going to regret this.
I understand all that.
It's just, that was my puppy.
Would you ever be a surrogate?
Depends who asked.
What if I asked?
Oh, Mon, sure!
Really?
Yes.
You're not asking me, are you?
No.
Yes.
Totally.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Yes, thank you

How did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night?
I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too.
But surprise!
I missed most of the party.
Charlie's a girl, right?
Yeah, she's this new professor in my department that I did not kiss.
I don't know why Joey had to kiss her.
Of all the girls at the party, God!
Why do you care so much?
Yes, Rachel.
Why do you care so much?
Because Ross is the father of my child.
You know, and I want him to hook up with lots of women.
All I'm saying is, I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.
I don't know.
They seemed to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils.
Wow.
Joey and a professor.
Can you imagine if they had kids?
And if the kids got her intelligence..   and Joey's raw sexual magnetism..   those nerds would get laid!
All right.
So, Ross, you're okay with all this?
I mean..
It's no big deal.
I just met her.
I'm fine with it.
God, I forgot how hot she was.
I'm gonna get some more coffee.
Oh, you know, I'll come with you.
Okay.
So a professor, huh?
Yeah.
She is cool.
And she's so smart.
Her mind is totally acrimonious.
Guess that's not how she used it.
I feel like I owe you an explanation.
I don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties.
I'm..   Well, I'm kind of embarrassed.
I really hope you don't think less of me.
Think less of you?
No.
I don't think less of you.
I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them.
Those people who like someone and don't kiss them..   those people are stupid.
I hate those people.
Actually, I'm a little surprised at myself.
I mean, Joey's so different from the guys I usually date.
They're all professors, intellectuals.
Paleontologists mostly.
You know, very cerebral..  Yeah, I know the type.
If we want to grab a bite before work, we'd better get acrimonious.
No?
Am I getting close?
Hey!
Hi.
Hey, how was the Met?
The museum was amazing.
Yeah, Joey really knows his art, huh?
Not so much, no.
He had clearly memorized all this stuff to say..   and some of it didn't even make any sense.
What do you mean?
Well, for one..   he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around.
Wait a minute.
When you guys walked into the Met, did you go to the right?
No.
No, we went to the left.
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey.
Still, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's fun.
What?
Actually, Joey's your friend..   and you don't know me that well.
It'd be weird.
Well, I mean, a little.
But no, what?
Go on.
Well..
I'm thinking that maybe Joey isn't the right guy for me right now.
You know, maybe I should be with someone..
I have more in common with.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
Yeah, but you know what?
I think you should give Joey a chance.
I mean, he's a great guy.
And sure, he doesn't know that much about art..   but you can always talk about that with someone else.
I guess that's true.
If you think about it..   he memorized all that stuff because he thought it was important to you.
You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.
He is very sweet.
Plus, he is hot!
That was gonna be my next argument.
You ready?
Yeah.
Let's go.
Wow!
Thanks, Ross.
Yeah.
Hey, Ross.
That art stuff worked.
You hooked me up.
Glad I could help, man.
Some of the stuff wasn't where you said it would be, but I made it work.
Well..   we're gonna figure this out.
Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining Oh, no.
Don't wait up!
Chip!
Oh, dear!
How do I turn this off?
I don't know any of your flashdances, but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.
All right.
Oh, Jack!
Oh, Judy

Hi.
What are you doing?
I was thinking of moving the couch.
Why would you want to do that?
So there'd be a decent place for me to sit?
Rach, there is a decent place.
And your lap does not count.
Come on, help me move this.
No, no, no.
No?
No.
Rosita does not move.
I'm sorry.
Rosita?
As in...?
As in "Rosita does not move."
It's just a chair.
What's the big deal?
It's the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen... ...and it's at an angle where you don't get any glare coming off Stevie.
Stevie the TV?
Is there a problem?
No.
What does he know?
Come on, Rosita.
Us chicas gotta stick together.
You bitch!
The One Where Rosita Dies Hey, you know what's weird?
I'll buy you a new one, okay?
We'll go to the store and get you a new chair right now.
She's not even cold yet.
Wouldn't Rosita have wanted you to move on?
I mean, you know, she did always put your comfort first.
That's true.
Joey?
Joe?
Full bag?
Beer's still cold.
Something terrible must have happened here.
Oh, no, no, no!
Stevie, I was never here.
I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself.
Yeah.
Me too.
Hey, how's the miracle chair?
Fine.
You know, this thing has speakers in the headrest?
No, really?
Yeah.
You can hook it to the TV and you get radio.
My chair heals itself.
Hey, Chandler.
Hey.
How'd you like to sit in a chair that reclines... ...has a rolling massage... ...and speakers in the headrest?
I've tried that so many times... ...they won't even let me in the store anymore.
What if I said you could do it in my apartment?
Are you telling me... ...you bought the chair that makes all others obsolete?
The chair that Sit Magazine called "Chair of the Year"?
I just purchased... ...the LaZBoy ECliner 3000.
Well, that's awesome!
That's great!
What made you do it?
It's a long story, but, I broke Joey's chair... Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You broke Joey's chair?
I thought I did, that's why I replaced it with mine.
That's how it got fixed!
You thought that elves came in and fixed it?
No.
Angels.
I'm getting my chair back.
Well, looks like it wasn't healed after all!
I guess this chair's mine now.
Joey, you broke my chair!
Your chair?
He thought he broke it, so he switched chairs.
So there was no miracle?
No, Joe.
No miracle.
Oh, no!
This is devastating!
My faith is shaken.
I'm glad I have a new chair to get me through this.
Have you seen Chandler's chair?
Joey broke it.
He got rid of it.
Are you kidding?
I get a Porsche and the Barcalounger's gone?
This is the best day ever
Stare at the wall.
Hardly move.
Be white.
You are good at that.
I had fun tonight.
You throw one hell of a party.
Thanks.
It was great meeting you.
If any of my friends ever get married or have a birthday or a Tuesday... Yeah, that'd be great.
So, I guess, good night.
Unless you want to hang around.
I'll let you play with my duck.
Stripper!
The stripper stole the ring!
Chandler, get up!
The stripper stole the ring!
What?
The ring is gone!
Just give me a minute to wake up for this.
You lost the ring.
You're the worst best man!
This isn't funny.
I go to sleep, everything's cool.
I make $1,600 a week.
Any of you guys make that?
Marry me.
I don't get it.
It was in my room all night.
She didn't take it.
I didn't take it.
You didn't take it.
Then who did?
We're trying to think.
I don't get how you know it's false labor.
If anything happens to him The vet said it's a simple procedure.
Things can go wrong.
What if he doesn't make it?
He will, Joe.
But what if he doesn't?
He's such a good duck.
I'm so worried about him!
Somebody lose a ring?
Oh, my God!
Thank you!
Thank you so much!
How's the duck?
Just fine.
You'll see him in a bit.
Great.
Thanks for being so cool.
No, that's all right.
You made me your best man and I totally let you down.
It's not your fault.
Yeah, it is.
You wouldn't have lost it.
Ross, you were right.
He should be your best man.
No, you should.
Don't argue.
I get to choose my best man.
I want both you guys.
Really?
Both you guys should be up there with me.
You two are my I'm lucky to have just one good Thanks, man.
I got to go check something, okay?
What a baby!
Total wuss.
How come you're getting Nana's ring?
Emily, did you know that that ring spent two days in a duck's colon
Oh, look!
The One With the Chicken Pox Honey, you made the bed again.
I told you, you don't have to do that.
This isn't camp.
Then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for.
I'm taking a shower.
Today I'll sing Jim Croce's "Leroy Brown."
Hey, Mon, I have a question.
Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town... ...or the fattest man?
The baddest.
Otherwise, the song would be "Fat, Fat Leroy Brown."
What are you doing?
I'm just waiting for you, sweetie.
Are you remaking the bed?
I'm sorry.
The way you did it, it was just fine.
Then you're redoing it because...?
You'll think I'm crazy.
You're pretty much running that risk either way.
Okay.
You see... ...the duvet tag shouldn't be at the top left corner... ...it should be at the bottom right corner.
That's not so crazy.
I'm just easing you in.
All right.
You see these little flower blossoms?
They should be facing up not down... ...because the head of the bed is where the sun would be.
You don't love me anymore, do you?
Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.
Really?
Wow.
Well, then, come on!
I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
Was I supposed to bring something too?
This is for the scratchy twins.
I taped oven mitts to their hands.
You're strict.
Well, it's for their own good.
You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under.
See, in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.
Exactly!
God, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now.
Tell me the truth.
Don't you like having everything on your desk perpendicular?
If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.
Very good.
Thank you.
Tomorrow, I'm gonna do your clocks.
You're gonna do what to my clocks?
Set them to my time.
I'm confused.
I thought we shared time.
No.
See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast.
Wanna know why?
Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen?
Forget it.
No, come on, tell me.
You don't understand.
Come on.
You don't have any obsessive things.
No, that's not true.
Oh, yeah?
Tell me one of yours.
One of my things is I always separate my sweat socks... ...from my dress socks.
What if they get mixed up?
Boy, I would just...
I would freak out.
You would not.
I can't believe this.
I hate this.
You're too normal.
I can't believe you don't have a "thing."
My boyfriend doesn't have a "thing."
See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.
Monica... ...wake up.
What's up?
I thought of a thing.
Yeah?
I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.
No.
You have to sleep on this side of the bed... ...because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
Or so I would have you believe.
So you have a side of the bed.
Everybody has a side of the bed.
Hey, come on.
You haven't heard my reason yet.
All right, go on.
I have to sleep on the west side... ...because I grew up in California... ...and otherwise... ...the ocean would be on the wrong side.
Oh, my God.
You're a freak!
How about that?
Where're you shipping off to?
So, the director is insisting that whoever play that part... ...be authentically, anatomically... ...not Jewish.
You know what I'm saying?
Yes!
No.
What?
An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be... Bar mitzvahed?
Think 13 years earlier, lose the rabbi, add a scalpel.
To get this part, you can't be...  No.
But you are?
You told them you weren't?
That's right.
Wow!
It's definitely all gone?
There's nothing there to work with?
What were you thinking?
I don't know.
I just want this part.
They say no matter what you're asked during an audition, say yes.
They want you to ride a horse, say you can.
You figure out how to do it later.
This is not like learning to ride a horse.
This is like learning... ...to grow a turtleneck.
I know, okay?
Tomorrow, when I go meet the director...
...I have to take my clothes off so they can see what my body looks like.
Oh, my God.
What are you gonna do?
I have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
Unless...
Unless what?
This may sound crazy, but there may be something we could... ...fashion.
Like what?
Well, I'm not sure yet.
Off the top of my head, I'm thinking... ...doublesided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower.
And please tell her to bring a cake!
We have a lot of options.
A number of prototypes for you to try on.
Those look great.
Okay, this one's a mushroom cap.
This one is made of bologna.
The toothpicks?
Just until the glue dries.
Thank God.
These are more realistic, but perishable.
Over here, we have pink suede, which is nice.
But if it gets wet, it'll shrink.
Maybe we'll just take that one away.
I also did a little something in fur, but that's really just for me.
Why don't you try these on?
We'll get a better idea of what works.
Thanks, you are such a good friend.
And this is so weird.
Okay, the taffy's too sticky.
Yeah.
What are you trying now?
The Fruit Rollup.
And?
Delicious.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
We have a winner!
What?
Which one?
The Silly Putty.
Not so silly anymore!
She's your cousin.
What's cool is, the character is from Naples, right?
My whole family's from Naples.
That's great.
Okay.
I've heard everything I need to hear... We just need to, uh... Leslie?
Joey, this is the awkward part.
Hey, right.
Not a problem.
I totally understand you need... ...to make sure I don't have any horrible scars or tattoos.
Don't you worry.
I have nothing to hide.
So, there you go.
That's me.
One hundred percent natural.
I tell you, that has never happened before.
Cassie, are you finding everything okay?
Okay.
I'll be home right after work.
Okay.
Okay, bye, Emma.
I love you.
Bye.
Bye.
They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk.
It's not so good.
I think it's sweet.
Bye, Emma!
Hey, listen, Joey.
About Molly, I would really prefer if you didn't go after her.
Why not?
It took months to find a good nanny.
And I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.
So you think I'm just gonna sleep with her..   and never call her again, and things are gonna get uncomfortable?
Yeah, that sounds about right.
Come on, there are plenty of other women out there.
Just forget about her, okay?
She's offlimits.
Oh, man!
What'd you have to go and say that for?
Now that you told me I can't have her, makes me want her even more!
What are you, a child?
Yes!
Just think of him as a really, really, really horny Ben.
No!
Look, Joey, come on now.
For me, please.
Just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.
Fine.
Take me home.
You mind if I join you?
Actually, I'd rather be alone.
You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.
Your thoughts?
Plural?
All right, fine.
I only have one thought.
It's about the hot nanny!
I gotta see her!
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
Now you're saying I can't see her?
You're killing me!
She's forbidden fruit!
It's like, like..   like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy.
Why are you doing this, huh?
Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?
Yes, as a matter of fact, he did.
So I can't let you go.
Interesting.
Now there are obstacles.
Hot nanny and me against the world!
This is the stuff great novels are made of.
Great novels?
Fine.
Mediocre porn.
Gavin Mitchell's office.
Do you see what all the guys see in her?
Wouldn't kick her out of bed.
No more vodka for me.
Hey, Rach.
So can I sing "Happy Birthday" to you now?
Yeah, sure.
All right.
So you see, Molly, what people don't understand..   is that acting is a discipline.
It takes a lot of hard work.
So where'd you study?
I didn't go to college.
No, where'd you study acting?
Molly, people don't study acting.
Molly, do you mind giving us just a minute?
Sure.
I'll go check on Emma.
Thanks.
Will the stable boy never get the princess?
What do you think you were gonna do, have sex with her here on my couch?
No.
The leather sticks to my ass.
This isn't fair.
What makes you think I'm gonna sleep with her..   and then blow her off, huh?
Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actually like her..   and might want something real?
Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel.
Okay?
I didn't think I could ever love again.
Come on!
Joe!
Hi.
Is Molly here?
Yeah, yeah.
Come on in.
Molly?
Hey.
Guys, this is Tabitha.
Hey.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay.
Well, Joey, I guess we have no problem.
It's like my favorite fairy tale come true.
The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian.
Okay.
Not for me.
Chip and I broke up.
Why?
What happened?
My parents are out of town, and Chip was going to come over.
And you were going to give him... ...your "flower."
Monica, can you just call it sex?
It really creeps me out when you call it that.
And by the way... ...while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his "tenderness."
Believe me.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Everyone... ...this is Chandler.
My roommate... ...and lead singer of our band.
This is Monica.
I'm Ross' little sister.
I'm so glad you could come.
We've got plenty of food, so I hope you're hungry.
Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
I'm so glad you brought him here.
I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
As long as the Pilgrims didn't eat it.
Damn it!
Does it feel weird around here now?
You know, since I've been away at college?
Not really.
That's cool.
So that's Rachel, the girl you've been writing all those songs about?
I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson!
I am never going out with him again.
I don't care how much he begs.
His begging days are over, now that he's with Nancy Branson.
I've just had it with highschool boys.
They're just silly.
They're just silly, stupid boys.
I'll start dating men.
I'm sorry, Judy.
I couldn't find that bowl you and Jack were looking for.
Call them Mom and Dad, you loser.
Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
It was great.
You should be a chef.
Guess what.
All this stuff about Nancy being a slut was all a rumor.
Chip dumped her, and he wants to come over to my house!
That is so great!
I know.
Oh, gosh.
Listen, if you and Chip do it tonight... ...promise me you'll tell me everything.
Totally.
It's not that big a deal.
We already kind of did it once.
But now you'll definitely know whether or not you did it.
I know.
And Chip promised that this time it'd last at least for an entire song.
I'm thinking of asking Rachel out tonight... ...maybe playing her that song we wrote last week.
"Emotional Knapsack"?
Right on!
But don't take long.
We're testing our fake ID's tonight.
Right, Clifford Alvarez?
Listen, Roland Cheng... ...if things go well, I may be out with her all night.
Dude, don't do that to me.
It's cool, you can stay here.
My parents won't mind.
It's not that.
I just don't want to be stuck here with your fat sister.
Why don't you finish off these pies?
I don't have any more room in the fridge.
No, thank you.
Judy, you did it.
She's finally full!
I called you fat?
I don't even remember that.
Maybe it'd jog your memory... ...if you guys played a little bit of "Emotional Knapsack."
I'm so sorry.
I really am.
I was an idiot back then.
I rushed the stage at a Wham concert, for crying out loud!
I can't believe you called her fat.
This is so nice.
Thank you for doing this.
Please!
Cooking soothes me.
So dig in!
It all looks so good.
Oh, my God.
I know.
My God, this rice is so I am so good!
Behind you.
They used to live here, and sometimes they migrate back over.
Is there some way that they could not be here?
Farm birds really kind of freak me out!
Here we go.
There you go!
Hey!
How'd you do that?
All gone.
So, farm birds, huh?
It's my only weird thing, I swear.
I would have told you.
I didn't know that they'd be here.
Can I serve you a little What?
Nothing.
It's just that I know that they're still out there.
They're across the hall.
That's two doors away.
It'll take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
That's not funny.
Would you feel better if we went someplace else?
We could pack this stuff up and go to your apartment.
They're working on it.
It's a mess.
I'm staying at my parents' house.
We could go there.
They're out of town.
It's a huge place, and it's got this gorgeous view.
It'd be very romantic.
What do you say?
Yeah, that works.
They can smell the fear.
Hi, you!
Oh, my God!
I know.
I can do more than cook.
I like her.
She seems smart.
Rachel, my parents.
So nice to meet you.
Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.
What, this?
Oh, no.
That's not what it is.
Okay, I work in fashion.
And this is a real dress, actually.
They're wearing it in Milan.
Part of my job is to wear the clothes and see how people respond.
Then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale's.
Obviously, in this case...
...I am going to report back: "U.S.A. not ready."
Maybe in L.A.
There you go!
Have you kids eaten yet?
We were going to do that after.
I mean, next.
Why don't we all get something to eat?
No use wasting this baby just lying around the house.
So we'll go eat.
You'll wear that.
We'll be eating and, of course, you'll be wearing that.
Here you go.
/ Thanks   Did you, you stay here all night?
Yeah.
So you took off my pants and shoes?
No, no, no.
You actually did that when you were dancing to the "Chicago" soundtrack.
Look, uh, Ross, about Rachel and I ,   Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay, because nothing's gonna happen.
What do you mean?
Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you're okay with it.
And clearly...  Hey, what are you talking about?
I'm fine!
It's okay, Ross.
You know?
I, I totally understand.
Of course you're not fine.
You're ....  You're Ross and Rachel.
Yeah, except we're not.
I mean we haven't been a couple in like ....   six years?
Oh my God!
Is that right?
Has it been that long?
That's what I hear, yeah.
Ha, this is crazy.
I mean six years   and because of me you guys aren't gonna be together?
Can I ask you something?
Really,   What is this thing with you and Rachel?
Come on, you know me.
You know.
Joey.
I'm crazy about her.
And she feels the same way?
I think so.
Well then, maybe it's time we all moved on.
Yeah, but Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.
No, but...
I want to be.
Hey,...
I will be.
Besides, I'm, I'm with Charlie, right?
Oh my God!
I'm still with Charlie, aren't I?
I mean she didn't see the dance, did she?
No, no, no.
That was ,uh , ...  That was just for me.
Are you, uh,...  Are you sure about this?
Yeah.
I'm sure.
And we're okay?
/Huh.
Hey Pheebs, / Hey.
Are you under the sheet?Yes.
Great, let's begin.
How's the pressure?
It's nice.
Wow, Phoebe, you are good.
Stating the obvious, but thank you.
And it's not weird, is it?No.
That's right, you just enjoy.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!Okay.
Oh, God, Phoebe!
I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing.That massage felt so good.
No, I got that.
Can we make it a weekly appointment?Okay.
You should know though,I've raised my rates to $200 an hour.
Okay.I mean 500.
What?600.
What's going on?
You make sex noiseswhen you get massaged.
It freaked me out.
After a while,I tried to hurt you.
It spurred you on.
You're crazy.
There's nothing sexualabout the noises I make.
There's nothing sexual about this?
Oh, God!
What are you looking at?
I mean, hi.
Oh, that's why Alexandra wears earplugswhen she gives me a massage.
It's not because she hates Enya.
This is embarrassing.I'm never getting a massage again.
Don't let this stop youfrom getting massages.
I have lots of clientsthat make those noises.
Really?Well, not clients.
Lovers.
We'll try it again.
Come back,and we'll work through it.
You sure?Yes.
I guess.Great!
Now, if you'll just excuse me.
So did you hear something you liked?
Not too shabby.I got this all off myself..   using my wife's tools.
Oh, my God.
How did you get in there?
You're messy.
No!
You weren't supposed to see this!I married Fred Sanford.
Chandler, you don't understand.
You know,how I organize everything, right?
Okay, okay, fine!
Now you know.I'm sick.
No, honey, you're not sick.
I don'tlove you because you're organized.
I love you in spite of that.
Really?
Promise you won't tell anyone?Yes.
Now that I know, if I've got extra stuff,can we share the closet?
Well..
It's just..
I'm afraid you might mess it up.
Hey.Hey.
So Rachel's all moved out?How you taking it?
That's it, just relax.
Come on, more.Oh, God!
You like that, don't you?
Yeah, right there.Want it there?
Take it there, baby.
Phoebe?Yeah, say my name.
Say it.
And now I'm goingto cover you back up.
And I won't be speaking with youfor several weeks
I'm guessing this is from.
Well, thank you, Melanie.
This one right here is from me.
It's light.
It rattles.
It's Travel Scrabble!
Thank you.
This one's from Joey.
It feels Like a book.
I think it's a book.
And it's a book!
It's Dr. Seuss!
That book got me through some tough times.
There is a Little child inside this man.
The doctors say if they remove it, he'll die!
Who's this from?
That's Ross' .
Oh, my God!
He remembered!
Remembered what?
It was months ago.
We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin.
I told him it was just Like one my grandmother had when I was Little.
I can't believe he remembered!
Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
It's so pretty!
This must've cost him a fortune.
I can't believe he did this.
Remember when he fell in Love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
What did you say?
Crystal duck.
The "Love" part?
Oh, my God!
That's good.
Just keep rubbing your head.
That'll turn back time.
This is unbelievable.
I mean, this is unbelievable!
I know.
This is really, really huge!
No, it's not.
It's small, it's tiny, it's petite, it's wee.
I don't think any of our lives will ever be the same ever again!
Is there a mute button on this woman?
I think this is so great!
I mean, you and Ross!
Did you have any idea?
No, none!
My first night in the city, he mentioned asking me out but nothing ever happened, so I just.
What else did he say?
Does he want to go out with me?
Given that he's desperately in Love with you he wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
Ross?
AII this time?
I've gotta talk to him.
He's in China!
The country.
Wait, his flight doesn't leave for 45 minutes.
What about the time difference?
From here to the airport?
You're never gonna make it!
I've got to try.
What'll you say to him?
I don't know.
Then maybe you shouldn't go.
Right, because if you're gonna break his heart, that can wait.
But if it's good news, tell him now.
Maybe I'II know when I see him.
Here, look.
AII right, does this help?
AII I know is, I cannot wait a week.
This is just too big.
I've just got to talk to him.
I've got.
Come on, they're gonna Love you
You guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.
Yes, but, Ross, you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
There are these two professors who are joining my department..   and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.
What's so bad about that?
I just know they'll be a couple of old windbags..   wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
Ross?
What?
These aren't suede.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for someone.
You don't, by any chance, know a Ross Geller?
No.
Hi.
Hi, I'm Ross Geller.
Oh, hi.
I'm Professor Wheeler.
Oh, that's.. That's.. That's nice.
It's good to meet you.
Thank you so much for taking the time to show me around.
No, it's no big deal.
If I weren't doing this, I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.
Is he gonna introduce us?
I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
By the way, I really enjoyed your paper..   on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis.
I wrote that in one night.
Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
Well, we should probably get going.
You know, we've got a lot of ground to cover.
Isn't another professor supposed to come with us?
I don't think so.
I'm pretty sure.
A Professor Spafford from Cornell?
Well, he's obviously late, and the rule in my class is:   If you can't come on time, then don't come at all.
An option that many of my students use.
Shall we?
We shouldn't wait for him?
You know what, he's a big boy.
I'm sure he'll find us, okay?
Professor Geller?
Oh, damn it!
And it's out of my system.
And then my wife and I went on a cruise to the Galapagos.
There was a seafood buffet you wouldn't believe.
There were clams and mussels and oysters..   and cracked crab..   and snow crab..   and king crab.
It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.
So where did you get your undergraduate degree?
And that's not all I'm allergic to.
Oh, it's not over.
I'm also allergic to peanuts and cashews..   and almonds and filberts..
So basically all nuts!
Interestingly, no.
You're kind of playing it fast and loose with the word "interesting."
If you'll excuse me, I'm going to use the restroom.
When I come back, remind me to tell you..   about the different types of animal dander I'm allergic to.
I've lost the will to live.
Let's ditch him.
What?
While he's still in the bathroom.
I am begging you.
Okay.
Okay, fine, but I just have one question for you.
When we exit, should we walk or run..   or prance or stroll..?
Stop it!
Stop it!
He talks slow, but he might pee fast.
Okay, let's move!
Oh, hey, you guys, this is Charlie.
Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica.
Hi.
Charlie will be joining my department.
You're a paleontologist too?
Yeah.
Oh, okay.
Now, what do you think..   of Renyard's new theory of species variegation in segmented arthropods?
Well, I think he's a little out there, but he does have some interesting ideas.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I have to take this.
Excuse me.
Renyard's theory of species variegation?
I saw the article on your coffee table.
I memorized the title to freak you out.
So did you two have fun?
Oh, my God.
She's great.
We have so much in common, and she's just cool, you know?
And funny.
And I don't know if you've noticed, but she's a hottie!

Somebody on the subway licked my neck!
Willy's still alive!
What are you guys doing?
My mom called.
They're announcing our engagement in the paper.
We're looking for a good picture of us.
I'm afraid that does not exist.
There are great pictures of us.
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this: Oh, my God, that's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.
I don't know what it is.
I just can't take a good picture.
Here's a great one.
Yeah, I'm not in that.
No, but look at me, all tan.
Why don't you go get portraits done by a professional photographer?
That's a great idea.
I bet they have one of those wind machines.
Yeah, that's great.
Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.
Chandler, what do you say?
All right, but I'm not going.
"I'm" going.
The One With The Engagement Picture Dude, that reverse layup.
Great, that's great, Monica.
Great.
Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile?
Okay.
I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?
No, I am.
Chandler, I know you can do this.
You have a beautiful smile.
I do?
Yeah.
Maybe you don't have to smile.
Let's try something else.
Try looking sexy.
Okay.
Or not.
I know.
Let's try a look... ...of faroff wonderment.
Gaze into our future, and think about our marriage and the days to come.
Chandler, what is the matter with your face?
This picture should say, "Geller and Bing to be married,"... ...not, "Local woman saves drowning moron."
Hey, don't laugh at him.
He's my drowning moron.
That's it, that's it!
Take it, take it!
I like this one.
It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
Can't all be bad.
Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes.
There it is.
Oh, my God, those are my bedroom eyes?
Why did you ever sleep with me?
Do you really want to pull at that thread?
I'm really having a good time.
There I am.
You okay?
Yeah, Joey said I needed to relax.
So he gave me an antihistamine.
What?
I fell asleep on the subway and went to Brooklyn.
Brooklyn is far.
What were you thinking?
But don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now.
Okay, see.
Look down.
Look down.
Chandler?
Yeah?
Hey, guys, check it out.
My mom sent me the paper.
Let's see it.
Oh, yeah, that looks good.
You make a very attractive couple.
Yeah, we look great together.
We really do.
Okay.
Imagine what our kids would look like.
We don't have to imagine.
I'm marrying her.
We'll just see
For my dessert...
I'm making a traditional English trifle.
Wow.
That sounds great!
And what are you making, Monica?
In case Rachel's dessert is so good that I eat all of it... and there's none left for anybody else!
Nothing.
Nothing?
No, sweetie.
I trust you.
If I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
You won't mess it up.
I love that.
You really have faith in me.
Thank you.
Question: How do you know when the butter is done?
It's done about two minutes before it looks like that.
The food smells great, Mon.
And the place looks so nice.
Hey, happy Thanksgiving, everybody!
Happy Thanksgiving!
Well, this has been great.
See you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Where you going?
We did say we'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having.
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
Some would say she's attractive, yes.
Who else is going to be there?
Her friends.
Her dancer friends?
Yes!
All right?
All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there... and they'll be drinking and dancing and we really want to go!
Dude, we were good.
You're not going.
You said you'd eat here and you'll eat here.
Yeah, and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls... is not very Thanksgivingy.
Oh, but it is.
It's like the first Thanksgiving when the Indians and Pilgrims sat down.
Then the Indians taught the Pilgrims... ...what it meant to be hot in the New World!
Oh, yes, of course.
Hello, Chandler.
Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful.
It is great to have you here.
Let us take your coats.
Whoa, it snowing out there?
No.
Monica, all this food looks wonderful.
You should do this for a living.
Okay, I have dandruff.
There's no need to laugh and point.
Chandler was laughing at your joke.
My joke wasn't funny.
You're killing us.
Will you serve the dessert already?
There's drunken dancers awaiting!
Look at it.
Isn't it beautiful?
Yeah.
What is it?
It's a trifle.
It's got all these layers.
First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then jam... then custard, which I made from scratch... then raspberries, more ladyfingers... then beef sauteed with peas and onions... then a little bit more custard... then bananas and then I put whipped cream on top.
What was the one right before bananas?
The beef.
Yeah, that was weird to me too.
But then I thought, "Well, there's mincedmeat pie."
That's an English dessert.
These people just put strange things in their food.
Can I borrow rum from your place?
Yeah, sure.
While I'm gone, don't you sneak a taste.
Beef in a dessert?
Joey.
God, your apartment is, like, 100 degrees.
Did it make you want to walk around in your underwear?
No.
Still not hot enough!
Will you hurry up?
Did you not hear me when I told you that Janine's friends are dancers?
And that they're gonna be drinking a lot?
No, I did.
But tell me again because it's so romantic.
You're whipping so slow.
Do it faster!
I don't want to make any mistakes!
If I screw it up, everybody's gonna be like: "Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
Just let me worry about making it, and you just worry about eating it.
Oh, Janine.
I know.
Just a quick question.
Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duvall.
Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
Sorry, I just can't sleep.
Where's that book you're reading with two women who are iceskating... ...and wearing those hats with the flowers on it.
Because every time I look at that cover, I'm like...
It's in the living room, where there's also a light... ...and no one will kick you in the shin.
What?
Please don't be a spaceship.
I'm sorry, I thought I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
With a wok?
Thought you were gonna read my book to put you to sleep?
It got interesting.
Damn you, Oprah!
Here, let me make the milk.
I'm up anyway.
You know what we could do now that we're up?
We could just talk to each other all night long.
Like we did when we were first going out.
It'd be fun.
Okay, that does sound fun.
Yeah.
So how bummed were you when the second sister died, huh?
The second sister dies?!
No.
No, I was talking about the book I was reading.
The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
That's correct.
Here's your milk.
What do you wanna talk about?
What?
What?
What?
Oh, were you sleeping, sweetie?
I'm sorry.
Here.
You still awake?
Yeah.
You?
You do know that was me that just said that, right?
Hey.
As long as we're both up... Yeah?
I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.
Man, I'm starving.
What are you doing?
Do you know what just happened?
Yeah.
We had sex, and then we fell asleep.
No.
We were in the middle of sex... ...and you fell asleep.
No.
No, that's not true.
No, best time ever.
Yeah.
You rock my world.
Monica?
What?
I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it.
So please wake up so we can do it right.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm ready.
Come on, big fella.
Okay.
Give me the good stuff.
Yeah.
No, no, no.
Don't fall asleep.
Okay, I'm going to make you some coffee.
Well, I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
Okay, I'm up.
I'm up.
That really was some of your best work.
I told you.
I can't believe it.
I've only got two hours until I call in sick for work.
I have to be up in seven minutes.
Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes... Really?
You want to?
You get the vacuum cleaner.
I'll get the furniture polish

Do you want a job with Popular Mechanics?
If you must work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for.
Look, you guys.
I'm going for anything here.
I can't be a waitress anymore.
I mean it.
I'm sick of the lousy tips.
I'm sick of being called "Excuse Me. "
Rach, did you proofread these?
Why?
Nothing.
I'm sure they'll be impressed with your "compuper" skills!
Oh, my God!
Do you think it's on all of them?
No, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few!
The One With the Poker Hey, guys.
Hi, ladies.
Can I get you anything?
Did you bring the mail?
Lots of responses.
Really?
Sure we have scones left!
Read them to me.
"Dear Miss Greene: Thank you for your inquiry.
However. "
We have apple cinnamon.
"Dear Miss Greene."
Your VISA bill is huge!
Give me that.
I can't believe you.
Linda's great.
Why won't you date her?
I don't know.
Is this still about her "The Flintstones could have really happened" thing?
It's not just that.
It's just, I want someone who does something for me who gets my heart pounding who makes me.
Little play things with yarn?
What?
Could you want her more?
Who?
Who?
Dee, the sarcastic sister from What's Happening!
Who?
Look, I am totally, totally over her.
I just.
Coffee?
No, we're fine.
We're fine.
Shut up!
We're not saying anything.
What?
Joey cried last night.
Thank you.
We were playing poker.
There was chocolate on the 3.
It looked like an 8.
God, you should've seen him.
"Read them and weep! "
And then he did.
Now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
What is that?
Some guy thing?
Like some kind of sexist guy thing?
Like it's poker, so only guys can play?
Women are welcome to play.
Then what is it?
Some kind of, like, some kind of, you know.
All right, what is it?
There just aren't any women in our game.
We just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
Please!
That is such a lame excuse.
It's a typical guy response.
Do you know how to play?
No.
But you could teach us.
No.
Come on, Will,just take off your shirt and tell us.
Ross?It was no big deal.
We said that..
The rumor was that..   you had both male and femalereproductive parts.
What?That's right.
We said your parents..   flipped a coin, decided to raise youas a girl, but you still had a hint of a penis.
Oh, my God!You started that?
You heard that?Everyone at our school heard it!
Everyone at my school heard it.You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader?
Oh, no!
It makes sense now.
This is whyAdam Carter wouldn't go out with me.
Why Billy would just stayin this region.
Billy's gay now, so that one'snot really our fault.
Why didn't you tell me?I thought it might be true.
I was afraid that you were gonna cryand then show it to me.
Stop staring!
There's nothing there!It's not true!
I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.
Come on, whip it out.
What?What?
You did start that rumor about Ross..   making out with Mrs. Altmann,our 50yearold librarian.
How did you know that?
It's true?No.
Yes, it is.
I saw you guys going at itbehind the card catalog.
Hey, what were you doing in the library?They had magazines.
She also made out..   with TaTakaKiKek the nightbefore he went back to Thailand.
In high school you made outwith a 50yearold woman?
Hey, she didn't look 50!Did she look 16?
There's a picture of herin the yearbook actually.
Wow.She didn't photograph well!
She probably wasn't familiarwith the process..   having spent most of her life sittingfor oil paintings.
How did this happen?
Did she lureyou to an earlybird dinner?
I was working late in the libraryone afternoon.
It was just the two of us.
She needed some helpwith her word jumble.
And one thing led to another.
If you must know,Anita was very gentle and tender.
May she rest in peace.
Didn't she walk with a cane?Only when it was damp!
I can't believe you told peopleabout this.
Everybody knew?
You know what?
I'm back in the club!Yeah!
Shall I call the meeting to order?Is everybody present?
I'm sorry, but I never got to be in a club.I didn't go to high school.
But three of us would meet behinda dumpster to learn French.
Fine, you can haveyour stupid, little club.
But what you did to me is way worsethan what I did to you.
You gave me a teeny weenie.Yeah!
You're just being silly.Rachel, even with that rumor..   you were one of the most popular girls.Everyone wanted to be like you.
One girl wanted to be like you so much,she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll.
Wow.
And Ross, if it weren't for her rumor,no one would've known who you were.
She put you on the map.As a romancer of the elderly.
Mrs. Altmann, you can tell,she used to be pretty.
The eyes did still sparkle.
This stuff is so way in the past.You've been through so much since then.
You got so much moreimportant stuff going on in your life.
Can't you just let this go?
She's right.We are having a baby together.
Hold on.
You got her pregnant?Yeah.
Are you getting married?No.
So you knocked her up but you'renot gonna marry her.
Dude.
Anybody?Okay.
It's exactly how I imaginedit would be.
Well, Joey, we're allvery proud of you.

Thank you.
Say, Rachel...
...I was wondering if you'd like to go to a movie with me sometime... ...as my lover.
Too out there.
Maybe you'd just like to get something to eat with me sometime... ...as my lover.
Hi.
Hi.
All right, let's go shopping.
I got a positive balance on my credit card I want to use before Citibank goes under.
Before we go, you know, there's something I need to say.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
I've kind of had this crush on you.
But since you were with Ross, I didn't do anything about it.
But now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you out sometime.
So that's what I'm doing... ...now.
I can put gel on it.
It doesn't matter.
I still wind up with this little... ...cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head.
It's so annoying.
Does it bug you?
You bug me.
Is there any chance you didn't see that?
Ross, you gotta stop, okay?
You can't just stare through the peephole for three hours.
You're gonna get peepeye.
I knew it.
I knew it.
I always knew she liked him.
You know, she'd say no, but here we are, right?
We just broke up, first thing she does!
You didn't just break up.
Hey, it's been, like, three weeks!
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up.
I mean, bullets have left guns slower.
Here they come!
Here they...
If she kisses him good night, I'll kill myself.
I swear.
I can't, I can't watch.
Come on.
Date over!
Date over!
Here we go.
She's going in.
Okay.
She's going in.
Wait!
He's going in!
He's going in!
The door's closed!
I can't see anything with the door closed!
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
Okay, I have to do something.
I mean, I have to stop it!
Stop what?
I don't know.
But I have a feeling that my being there will do it.
They only make 20 grand a year and they have to work nights.
I'll go over and I will borrow something!
Juice!
I need juice!
No!
You can't!
They must be stopped!
I am your friend... ...and I am not gonna let you do this!
You are surprisingly strong!
I need juice!
People need juice!
Look, man... People need juice!
Listen to me!
Juice.
They need... She's moving on, okay?
If it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else.
And unless you're thinking about subletting my peephole... ...you are gonna have to get used to the fact the relationship is over!
Okay, man?
It's over.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
It's just I miss her so much.
I know.
Is it just me, or did "subletting my peephole" sound kind of dirty?
Why do your coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
Oh, that's so Monica can keep track.
That way if one of them's missing, she can be like, "Where's number 27?"
You know what?
No, and I don't think I'm gonna want to.
I can't do this.
Yep.
That's what I didn't want to know.
Oh, Mark, I'm just doing this for the wrong reasons, you know?
I'm just doing it to get back at Ross.
I'm sorry.
It's not very fair to you.
Fair, shmair.
You know?
Look, you wanna get back at Ross, I am here for you.
Really.
No.
No.
I say, I say we get back at him right here on this couch.
Right here!
Oh, God.
I'm sorry about this.
That's okay.
You sure?
Yeah.
I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
Just because she went to Yale Drama, she thinks she's, like... ...the greatest actress since, since sliced bread.
Your first line is, "my name is Claude."
So just repeat after me.
Je m'appelle claude.
(_....Je de coup, plau.)
Je m'appelle claude.
Je de ple, mloo.
_   Huh.
It's not quite what I'm saying.
Really?
Sounds exactly the same to me.
It does, really?
Yeah.
All right, let's just try it again.
Je m'appelle claude.
Je dup kol, mlu.
No !
Okay.
Maybe if we just break it down.
Okay, let's just... let's try it one syllable at a time.
Okay, so repeat after me.
Je / Je / M'A / M'A / Pelle / Pelle  Great.
Okay, faster.
Je / Je / M'A / M'A / Pelle / Pelle Je m'appelle./ Me poo poo.
Okay, it's too hard.
I can't teach you.
What are you doing?
I have to go before I put your head through a wall.
We'll now count from one to five.
Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq.
Enh, bluh, blah, fluh, flank.
Good job.
Thank you.
Hey.
Hey, Joey.
Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday.
And I thought about it a lot.
I was too impatient.
So let's try it again.
No, that's okay.
I don't need your help.
I worked on it myself.
And I gotta say I am pretty good.
Really?
Can I hear some of it?
Sure, sure.
Okay.
blay de la blay de blu blah blay!
See?
You're not... you're not... again,  you're not speaking french!
Oh, well, I think I am!
Yeah.
And I think I'm definitely going to get the part.
How could you possibly think that?
For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!
Shovely joe.
Whenever you're ready, Joey.
Right.
Jai boo boo, claude.
Uh, sle poo.
Laylu blah blu.
I'm sorry.
What's going on?
Dude, come on.
French it up.
Joey, do you speak French?
Toot de la smor!
Blu, blu ay, blu blah.
Foo...   you know what?
I think this audition is over.
Excuse me.
I am Regine Filange.
I was passing by when I heard this man speaking the,  the regional dialect of my French town of estee lauder.
You really think this man is speaking french?
Oh, sa sa!
Ecoutez, je vais vous dire la verite.
[Okay, I'll tell you the truth.]
C'est mon petit frere.
Il est... un peu retarde.
Alors, si vous pouviez jouer le jeu avec lui?
[Would you please just humor him?]
Good job, little buddy.
That was some really good French.
But I think we're going to go with someone else for the part.
Oh.
All right.
But my french was good?
It was great.
See?
Merci.
Au revoir.
[Thanks.
Goodbye.]
Tout de la fruit.
Emma's down for the night.
Okay, you ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?
Let's do it.
All right, have a good time.
Not gonna find any clothes in there.
Hey, you guys.
Hi.
Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?
Chris Bailey?
Yeah, right.
When was the last time he made a submission deadline for an abstract?
Why are you laughing?
Just seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist.
It's fun.
Yeah.
So you're up for keynote speaker?
Who's deciding?
Professor Sherman.
I'm meeting with him today.
He's a pretty tough guy to impress.
I think I know how to dazzle him.
You're not gonna to do a magic trick, are you?
No.
Hey, guys.
I want to ask you something.
I may get to speak at this paleontology convention.
If I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.
I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work and/or are sick.
It's in Barbados.
But you come first.
I'm there.
The data we're receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing..   of these fossils are staggering.
I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given.
But if they're off by even a 100,000 years or so..   then you can just throw most of our assumptions..   you know, right in the trash.
So, what I'm saying is..   Is that..   Is that repercussions could be huge.
I mean, not just in paleontology, but if you think about it..   in evolutionary biology, genetics, geology.
I mean, truly, the mind boggles.
Well, that's not what you want.
I need to talk to Charlie.
Is she there?
No, she went shopping with Rachel.
Why?
What's up?
I'm meeting with Professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker.
How's it going?
It could be better.
He fell asleep.
What?
But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!
Barbados.
Fine, I'll rent a car and drive.
You have to get that job.
What am I supposed to do?
He's out cold.
In fact, he was just talking in his sleep before..   and evidently he wants someone named Fran to "spank him harder."
Well, just wake him up.
I can't.
If he realizes that I'm the one who put him to sleep, I won't get the job.
That's a tough one.
Oh, wait a minute.
This happened to me before.
Yeah, I was auditioning for a play, and the producer fell asleep.
I..   No, wait a minute.
It was me who fell asleep.
I mean, hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while?
Hey, guys, dinner's ready.
Thanks for sticking up for me.
God, you are such a nice person.
I try.
Oh, my God, you really want me to be the keynote speaker?
Just because his greatgrandmother was obese?
Listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey!
Including me!
Do you wanna go?
I can take a couple days off work.
Of course you can take a couple days off, because this trip includes me!
I've got a presentation tomorrow.
I can't miss that.
I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit.
I waited a year for this.
Sounds great.
I'll call the airlines.
That'll be nice to have the apartment to myself.
To walk around naked.
No, so I can be by myself.
Have a little alone time.
Naked alone time.
Just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked.
You live alone, you don't walk around naked.
Why does it takes me so long to answer the door?
So far, is this trip to Las Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
Okay, London, 1.
This is gonna be a real horserace.
Oh, look what happened.
Check me out.
I'm in my kitchen... ...naked.
I'm picking up an orange.
I'm naked.
I'm lighting the candles.
Naked.
And carefully.
Oh, my God!
That's Rachel, naked!
I can't look at that.
I am looking at this.
Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes.
Unless she wants me to be looking at that.
She knows I'm home.
She knows I can see her.
What kind of game is she playing?
I think maybe someone's lonely tonight.
Dr. Geller.
Stop it.
You're being silly.
Or am I?
Love to love you baby Darn it!
May I come in?
Yeah, if you want to.
Do you want me to?
Yeah, sure?
So do I.
Okay, Rach, before anything happens...
...I wanna lay down a couple of ground rules.
This is just about tonight.
I won't go through with this if it'll raise the question of "us."
Now, I'm just letting you know... ...this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
No, it's the graduation song.
Oh, my God!
It's like a guy never lived in here.
You gotta be careful.
This girl thing is dangerous.
It's spreading.
It is?
Is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
Is that your tiny little box that's too small to put anything in?
Okay, this is not good.
You are a guy, okay?
This is a "guy's" place.
Soon, you'll be soaking your fingers in stuff.
And your head's gonna be under a big, brown, drying, big, drying..
It's not good.
You're right.
I'll talk to her.
Talk to her.
Be a man!
I'm a man.
Defend yourself!
We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
Be right there, sweetums.
Totally different situation.
Can I talk to you for a second?
There's a kid in this picture.
Do you know this kid?
Is it a relative?
No.
I just thought it was cute.
That's what I was afraid of.
Okay...
I really want you to feel at home here, but... some of this new stuff, it's too girlie.
Like what?
Like this.
Pictures of cute babies we don't know.
We can't have that.
Joey, it's Anne Geddes.
She's a famous artist.
I don't know this baby.
I don't know if she's a famous artist or not.
I don't want to be a jerk, but you're changing too much around here.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to make the place a little nicer.
But it's too much stuff.
You know, you got the candles and the "foofy schmoofer" thing here.
Over here, you got a picture of a watering can.
I just thought..
I'm sure it's a famous watering can.
But come on.
And what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
It's a curling iron.
Well, that's okay then.
Okay, my towels, for instance.
I come into the bathroom... and my towel is not on the floor, where I keep it.
It's up here on some hook.
And it smells different.
It's clean.
It feels different.
It's dry.
All right, I can make my peace with the clean, dry towels.
Also what is with these chips you bought?
It's potpourri.
You're supposed to smell it.
Well, that's like summer in a bowl.
This has been a girlie day.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
I just feel like I need to be in a "guy" place... do kind of a "man" thing.
You go over to Joey's and... drink some beer and hammer up some dry wall.
When guys hang out, they don't just drink beer and hammer up dry wall.
When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear.
I'm sorry.
We do.
I don't know why I said that.
Hey, Chandler.
Come on in.
We're knitting potholders.
No, thanks, Josephine.
Ross, I was wondering if.. Oh, my God!
Where are all the men?
Look... We gotta get rid of all this girlie stuff in here.
I gotta be a man!
The living room has to remain a guy place, okay?
That's the way it has to be.
I'll just put it all in my room.
Good.
Great.
Thanks for being so understanding.
I didn't want to make a big deal out of this.
But you could put the picture of the famous baby in my room.
I mean, if you want to.
Okay.
And maybe the watering can there.
Sure.
And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
Joey, do you want me to put it all in your room?
Okay
How was it with your friends?
Okay, how would you like some TikiDeath punch?
What's that?
Well, it's rum and.
Okay.
We thought since Phoebe's staying over we'd have a slumber party.
We got trashy magazines.
We got cookie dough.
We got Twister.
And I brought Operation.
But I lost the tweezers so we can't operate.
But we can prep the guy.
Rach, it's the VISAcard people.
Oh, God.
Ask them what they want.
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to?
Yes, hold on.
There's been unusual activity on your account.
But I haven't used my card in weeks.
That is the unusual activity.
They just wanna see if you're okay.
They wanna know if I'm okay?
They wanna know if I'm okay.
Okay, let's see.
Let's see.
The FICA guys took all my money.
Everyone I know is either getting married or pregnant or promoted.
And I'm getting coffee.
And it's not even for me!
If that sounds like I'm okay, then tell them I'm okay.
Okay?
Rachel has left the building.
Can you call back?
You should feel great.
You're doing this amazing independent thing.
Monica, what is so amazing?
I gave up, like, everything.
And for what?
You are just like Jack.
Jack from downstairs?
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
Ah, the other Jack.
See, he gave up something, but he got those magic beans.
Then he woke up and there was this big plant outside of his window, full of possibilities and stuff.
And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village.
Okay, but Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow.
I gave up an orthodontist.
Okay, I know I didn't love him.
See, Jack did love the cow.
But, see, it was a plan.
It was clear.
Everything was figured out and now everything's like.
"Flupie"?
You're not the only one.
We don't know where we're going.
At some point, it's all gonna come together and it's just gonna be "unflupie. "
Yeah, like that's a word.
Okay, but, Monica, what if it doesn't come together?
Well, because you just.
I don't like this question.
See, you guys?
What if we don't get magic beans?
I mean, what if all we've got are beans.
Wait, there's no money?
Well, this is terrible.
You guys are gonna have to get married in, like, a rec center.
Oh, my God, you're right.
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
No, it's not gonna be okay.
No swing band, no lilies.
No, but that's good.
You don't want lilies.
If a cat ate them, it would die.
It's gonna be okay.
I mean, you don't need to have this... ...rustic Italian feast.
You don't need this custommade... ...empirewaisted, duchess satin gown.
You can wear offtherack.
It's really gonna be okay.
The important thing is that we love each other and we're gonna get married.
Do you even understand what "offtherack" means?
Why don't you pay for it yourself?
How?
I don't have any money.
Well, I have some.
How much?
Well, close to... Are you kidding me?!
How much?
Enough for wedding scenario A.
How great are you, you little saver!
This is exactly the budget of my dream wedding.
You guys are so made for each other.
You're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
Yeah.
Look, Mon, I've been saving this money for six years... ...and I kind of had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
Hello, Mr. Chandler.
Sweetie, this is the most special day of our lives.
I realize that, honey, but I'm not gonna spend all the money on one party.
Honey, I love you.
But if you call our wedding a party one more time... ...you may not get invited.
We can always earn more money.
We're only gonna get married once.
I understand, but I have to put my foot down.
The answer is no.
You're gonna have to "put your foot down"?
Yes, I am.
Money and a firm hand.
Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
Hey, Rach.
Joey.
Hey, Rach, do you smell smoke?
...I've been thinking.
It's not fair of me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding.
I mean, you work really hard for that.
Well.
Well, you work for that.
Look, I've thought about it too.
I'm sorry.
I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
You do?
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down.
Look, when I proposed, I told you... ...that I would do anything to make you happy.
And if having the perfect wedding makes you happy... ...then that's what we're gonna do.
You are so sweet.
What about the future and stuff?
Forget about the future and stuff.
So we only have two kids.
We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
Have you thought about that?
Yeah.
How many kids were we gonna have?
Four.
A boy, twin girls and another boy.
What else did you think about?
Well, stuff like where we'd live, you know.
Like a small place outside the city... ...where our kids could learn to ride their bikes.
We could have a cat that had a bell on its collar... ...and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door.
We'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
You know what?
I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
Sure you do.
No.
I want everything that you've just said.
I want a marriage.
You sure?
I love you so much.
I love you.
When you were talking about our future, you said cat.
But you meant dog, right?
Yeah, totally.
Oh, good.
